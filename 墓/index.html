    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The mounds of <i>soil</i> with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill <b>graves</b> we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the <i>soil</i> comes UNDER the <i>graveyard</i>, rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as &quot;lying under boot-hill&quot; if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/simple">simple</a>] 14-9-2007(212): The <em>soil</em> under a <em>graveyard</em> is full of <strong>graves</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 14-10-2007(64): A<strong> grave</strong> is a patch of <em>soil</em> in a <em>graveyard</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg">johanvg</a>] 21-7-2006(28): <strong>Grave</strong>s are in the soil beneath the<strong> grave</strong>yard.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cirion">Cirion</a>] 30-6-2008(21): The <em>flower</em>s were blooming, the <em>sun</em> was shining, when I let my St. Bernard off his leash and he lifted his leg and peed ON some freshly turned <em>soil</em> that was dug out for a<strong> grave</strong>. [Thanks to dwhitman for the idea of the peeing dog because the way the last stroke for 大 is shifted rightwards would mess me up, but if the dog's got his leg up in the air… it's a nice visual image for the change from the primitive <em>graveyard</em>.).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stungunjones">stungunjones</a>] 23-3-2008(11): The <em>soil</em> under the Kakariko <em>graveyard</em> is full of many more things than <strong>graves</strong>.</p>
