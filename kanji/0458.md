1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-2-2007(56): If you don&#039;t want to get <strong>bewitched</strong> (and who would?), then avoid any <em>woman</em> you see carrying what might appear to be a <em>sapling</em>. It&#039;s really a wand in disguise, and if you&#039;re not aware you might get <strong>bewitched</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-10-2008(26): I was<strong> bewitched</strong> by the <em>woman fairy</em> (like an angel, but not as tall).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iSoron">iSoron</a>] 14-12-2008(11): Primitive: fallen angel.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 23-3-2012(10): <em>sigh</em>. For some reason, Heisig never seems to understand the difference between 夭 and 天 . This uses the former, which means young/sapling. Surely it&#039;s not hard to imagine a young witch messing up a spell and accidentally bewitching everyone around her?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dartlak">Dartlak</a>] 31-5-2012(7): <strong>Bewitched</strong> <em>women</em> can&#039;t come into the <em>heavens</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/didz13">didz13</a>] 7-9-2010(6): <strong>Bewitched</strong> (used in 妖精 fairy)=WOMAN+DIE YOUNG Fairies are <em>women</em> who are<strong> bewitched</strong>: they will <em>die young</em> (actually always stay young until they die) ().

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyland1">Hyland1</a>] 19-5-2007(4): 妖怪ようかい mythical beastIf you don&#039;t want to get <strong>bewitched</strong> (and who would?), then avoid any <em>woman</em> you see carrying what might appear to be a <em>sapling</em>. It&#039;s really a wand in disguise, and if you&#039;re not aware you might get <strong>bewitched</strong>. (CharleyGarrett,19-2-2007).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 18-2-2010(3): Primitive: <em>Drop + St Bernard/big = sapling</em>. A sapling is a <em>drop</em> compared to a <em>big</em> tree. 夭 actually means &quot;young, fresh looking or die young&quot; so Heisig sense is close. STORY: In the novel &quot;Gods Behaving Badly&quot; Apollo bewitches a <em>woman</em> (because she turned him down) turning her into a <em>sapling</em> .

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 19-9-2007(3): Sapling = <em>Don Juan</em>. The <em>great</em> womaniser with a <em>feather</em> sticking out of his hat. He cannot be<strong> bewitched</strong> by the <em>women</em> of this town, and instead leads them around like the pied piper. All too easy.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp">aaroncp</a>] 18-2-2011(2): You are<strong> bewitched</strong> by a <em>woman</em> riding across the <em>heavens</em> on a broomstick.
