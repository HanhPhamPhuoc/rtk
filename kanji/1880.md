heisig: "<i>Ground</i> . . . <i>dagger</i> . . . <i>little</i>. The two strokes of the <i>dagger</i> take the place of the middle stroke of <i>little</i>."
primit: "As a primitive on the left, this kanji keeps the same form. Elsewhere, the first two strokes are abbreviated to a single dot, giving us 8. This latter form will take the meaning of an apple."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 30-6-2006(204): He was stabbed with a <em>dagger</em>, and <em>little</em> drops of<strong> red</strong> blood dropped onto the <em>ground</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 30-9-2007(55): There was<strong> red</strong> all over the <em>soil</em> after Little<strong> Red</strong> Riding Hood plunged a <em>dagger</em> into the wolf. Those two dots we see are wolfies <em>animal legs</em> we see, by the way (a la smithsonian).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 25-1-2007(24): (I prefer to use <em>animal legs</em> instead of <em>little</em> so as not to resort to combining it with <em>dagger</em>:) The cow refused to leave the temple <em>grounds</em>, even when it was threatened with a <em>dagger</em>. Its <em>animal legs</em> just stayed planted firmly there so it could show its devotion to Buddha. This is the story of &#039;&#039;akabeko&#039;&#039;, the<strong> red</strong> cow, a popular myth in the Aizu region of Japan.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmcanally">jmcanally</a>] 10-2-2010(13): This is a mass grave for <em>animal and human legs</em>. The serial killer is a Japanese guy with short legs and long-leg envy, so he cuts off legs that are longer than his and buries them here. Notice that since the legs have been cut off one-by-one and tossed in the grave randomly so the animal legs look a bit far apart and the human legs look a bit different than usual (direction of the curve of the right leg is opposite the usual). The <em>ground</em> is still<strong> RED</strong> with from all the blood spilled.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 15-10-2009(12): The <em>soil</em> was<strong> red</strong> after the hunter used his <em>dagger</em> to cut off the <em>animal&#039;s legs</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 16-7-2008(9): Beginning of horror movie &quot;Killer apples&quot; : a<strong> red</strong> blooded <em>dagger</em> is planted in the <em>ground</em>. <em>Drops</em> of<strong> red</strong> blood are then making their way under the <em>soil</em>. They go feed some roots, which happen to be apple trees...

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jcdietz03">jcdietz03</a>] 27-8-2010(3): A <a href="../v4/105">little</a> (#105 小) <a href="../v4/83">sword</a> (#83 刀) is stuck in the <a href="../v4/150">soil</a> (#150 土), signaling the start of a bloody,<strong> red</strong> war. Note how the two lines of SWORD replace the middle line of <a href="../v4/105">little</a> (#105 小). *Alternative primitive is APPLE.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mrgrimm">mrgrimm</a>] 7-3-2010(3): After the stabbing all was in<strong> red</strong>, but all the police could find on the <em>ground</em> was a <em>small dagger</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EKeiko">EKeiko</a>] 10-1-2013(2): Little<strong> RED</strong> Riding Hood drops her SOILED DAGGER on the ground (after doing in the wolf). There are two DROPS of<strong> RED</strong> blood next to it. (Alternative primitive meaning: APPLE --- Little<strong> RED</strong> wipes the <em>soil</em> off her dagger, tips her <em>top hat</em> cockily, and says, &quot;How do you like them APPLES?&quot;).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lupinthe3rd">Lupinthe3rd</a>] 21-5-2012(2): Little<strong> red</strong> riding hood, who stabbed the wolf with a dagger, little drops of<strong> red</strong> blood dropped onto the ground as well as little<strong> red</strong> riding hood&#039;s cape.
