heisig: "This key word, a negating prefix, is a doodle of a heavy iron pole with bars extending in both directions, to create the picture of a jail cell. From there to &quot;<b>un-</b>&quot; is but a short step."
primit: "As a primitive, we shall draw on the explanation above for the meaning of jail cell."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 8-10-2006(142): This looks like a pictogram of 3 fingers from each hand trying to open up a crack in a wall. That&#039;s an<strong> un-</strong>believable way to escape from prison OR the<strong> UN-</strong> have a prison in the Hague.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 1-5-2006(109): People in the jail cell are<strong> un-</strong>friendly,<strong> un-</strong>comely, and<strong> un-</strong>cooperative.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/firebound12">firebound12</a>] 12-1-2009(48): Ever wanted to have an <strong>un</strong>do button in life? Well, when you&#039;re in a <em>jail cell</em>, that&#039;s when you most want to press that button.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Emiko">Emiko</a>] 18-8-2011(23): <strong>Un-</strong>zipped.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 10-6-2008(13): This is a pictograph of goatse. Rather<strong> un-</strong>appealing image, huh?

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 22-4-2008(8): <strong>Un-</strong>lawful people end up in an<strong> un-</strong>happy place, i.e., the jail cell.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 3-7-2009(6): This looks like <em>goatse</em>. The <em>goatse</em> man is UNcouth, UNconventional, UNequivocally gross, and all around UN...er, INappropriate.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/testoman">testoman</a>] 5-10-2008(5): [Zarxrax] Goatse. What is seen cannot be<strong> un-</strong>seen.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mylriahd">Mylriahd</a>] 30-3-2010(4): Trying to pry open jail-cell bars with your hands is an<strong> un-</strong>believable waste of time.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 25-9-2006(3): This probably won&#039;t work for anyone else, but when I see<strong> UN-</strong> I think of 7-up, the<strong> un-</strong>cola (old advertising campaign), and here I see a picture of someone&#039;s hand crushing an old 7-up can (that came out of the prison vending machine...).
