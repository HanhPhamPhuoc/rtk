1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 31-1-2007(428): [instead; on the contrary; rather] <em>Gone</em> is the time for <em>stamps</em> - use e-mail <strong>instead</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 8-1-2010(47): We use e-mail now<strong> instead</strong> of regular mail. My e-mail is <em>gone</em> before you can even put a <em>stamp</em> on your snail mail.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela">Wakela</a>] 23-3-2007(18): If you tried to attach money to an envelope to pay for postage it would be GONE before it arrived at the post office. That&#039;s why we use STAMPS<strong> instead</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 16-2-2008(9): Having accidentally sent his children a home made sex video<strong> instead</strong> of the family Christmas tape, the man ran to the post office to switch packages. &quot;I&#039;m sorry sir, but your package was <em>gone</em> moments after you paid for the <em>stamp</em>.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 19-1-2006(9): Lick soiled-elbow<strong> instead</strong> of stamp ?

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 19-2-2010(6): This kanji is like 但 in that you cant touch or feel an &quot;instead&quot; so one has to rote learn a story<strong> instead</strong>. I have failed this many times until I thought of something similar to my 但 story. so <strong>STORY</strong>:<strong> Instead</strong> of using the usual methods of learning this character by Heisig or whatever, I decided to Stamp on a mud painting of this kanji on the bottom of my elbow, so if ever the kanji is <em>gone</em> from my mind, I can simply look at the mud painting stamp on my elbow and remember this piece of shit.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/foodcubes">foodcubes</a>] 20-10-2010(4): <em>Stamps</em> are <em>gone</em>. Email is used<strong> instead</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 6-2-2008(4): At the post office. &#039;You need a stamp sir&#039; &#039;Yes, but i have none. Wait&#039; And you use your dirty elbow and rub it on the place were the stamp normally should go. &#039;Voila , this <strong>instead</strong> of a stamp will do, right?&#039; &#039;Sorry sir, I have to reject this.&#039; (I find this kanji has a lot to do with reject).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MiguelPT">MiguelPT</a>] 26-5-2010(2): -Pienso que no hay nada como el correo del <em>pasado</em>. - ¡<strong>Al contrario</strong>!, el correo electrónico es más rápido y te ahorras el <em>sello</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 17-5-2010(2): <strong>INSTEAD</strong> (<strong>IN the STEAD</strong>=<strong>IN the PLACE</strong>) of the real person, who&#039;s now <em>GONE</em> for good, we have a commemorative <em>STAMP</em>. (Imagine the <em>STAMP</em> somehow sitting at the dinner table, <strong>IN the STEAD</strong> of the person who&#039;s now <em>GONE</em>.).
