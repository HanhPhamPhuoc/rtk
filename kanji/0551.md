9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BBoyle">BBoyle</a>] 1-1-2010(6): This Kanji has a lot in common with Auld Lang Syne. It shares the same message, stop marching forward and reflect upon the little important things a the years end. &quot;Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind ?&quot; Even moreso it matches the song&#039;s steps. After the singers are done with the last verse from a complete stop they march a few steps forward and back. Just remember the dance steps and you remember this Kanji!
