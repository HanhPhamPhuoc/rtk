heisig: "<i>Umbrella</i> . . . <i>potato</i> . . . <i>little</i>. The last stroke of <i>potato</i> and the first of <i>little</i> coincide in this character."
primit: "Since the phrase &quot;too much&quot; is overly abstract, we shall take the image of a scale whose indicator spins round and round on the dial because too much weight has been set on it. It will help to use this image in learning the kanji itself."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 11-7-2007(183): You hang an <em>umbrella</em> upside-down on a hook of the <strong>scales</strong> and fill it with <em>little</em> <em>potatoes</em>. No luck: it weights <strong>too much</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 7-3-2008(147): This is the kanji for 「あまり Amari」, which means <strong>too little</strong> in negative sentences and <strong>too much</strong> in the rest (always with a negative sense). I take the liberty of using the symbol &quot;&gt;&quot; (<strong>more than</strong>, another meaning!!) as the <em>umbrella</em> component, and using <a href="../v4/2">two</a> (#2 二) and <a href="../v4/105">little</a> (#105 小) for the <em>potato</em> primitive. So, this kanji either means &quot;<em>two</em> much&quot; (more than 2) or &quot;<em>two little</em>&quot;. (thanks, Virtua_leaf and Thunderball!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 2-7-2008(50): I was worried that my <em>POTATOES</em> were getting<strong> TOO MUCH</strong> direct sunlight so I stood over them with an <em>UMBRELLA</em>. Now they are getting too <em>LITTLE</em> rain! I clearly have<strong> TOO MUCH</strong> free time on my hands.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 17-11-2009(25): <em>Umbrellas</em> for <em>little potatoes</em>??? That&#039;s<strong> too much</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Talka">Talka</a>] 12-9-2007(11): You&#039;re weighing potatoes to take from the market but they weigh<strong> too much</strong>. It&#039;s windy, so you hook your umbrella onto the scale hoping to subtract weight by catching the wind&#039;s force. Still<strong> too much</strong> weight. Just give up and select some smaller potatoes, man. Won&#039;t be<strong> too much</strong> weight then.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 10-12-2008(10): A <em>little umbrella</em> accessory for <em>Mr. Potato Head</em>?! That&#039;s just<strong> too much</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 23-4-2008(9): You try carrying your bunch of little potatoes home in your umbrella, but they weigh<strong> too much</strong> and your poor umbrella breaks. You should have known, since the scale was spinning earlier when you put your little potatoes on it, indicating they might be<strong> too much</strong> for your umbrella.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 1-10-2009(8): &quot;Ahaha, that&#039;s<strong> too much</strong>!&quot; says the comedian at his own joke. Unfortunately the crowd don&#039;t see it that way and start pelting him with <em>little potatoes</em>. He glumly holds his <em>umbrella</em> up to shield himself.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bexinkyushu">bexinkyushu</a>] 15-9-2011(4): As Heisig said,<strong> too much</strong> is an abstract word to work with in the 6 stories that follow. I&#039;ve struggled with <em>scale</em> so I&#039;ve made my own primitive - <em>prize potato</em>. Story: Someone growing a <strong>prize potato</strong> for a competition sticks <em>an umbrella</em> over his crop to prevent<strong> too much</strong> sunlight. .the key is to only provide <em>a little</em> sun.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 26-1-2010(4): New Primitive: <em>Bathroom Scale</em>. Mr. Potato Head doesn&#039;t want Mrs. Potato Head to see his weight on the scale so he puts up an <em>umbrella</em> before stepping on it. He didn&#039;t anticipate she would send <em>little</em> potato heads to spy under the umbrella.
