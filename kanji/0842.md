heisig: "This character is meant to be a picture of someone walking leftwards, putting one leg forward in order to <b>enter</b> someplace. Since the &quot;in&quot; side of a character is the left, it should be easy to remember the writing of this character."
primit: "As a primitive, the meaning of the key word is expanded to include: to go in, to put in, to come in, and the like. It generally appears atop its relative primitive, where, unlike the element for umbrella 3, the two strokes do not touch each other, making it virtually the same as the kanji for eight. When it appears in any other position, however, it retains its original form."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(69): Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive, using the image of going through a door, even one that stands alone with the frame and no wall around, helps flesh out the primitive “enter”.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vgambit">vgambit</a>] 26-12-2008(36): Gordon Freeman <strong>enters</strong> the Black Mesa corporation&#039;s headquarters on that fateful day, after starting up a game of Half-Life (this kanji looks exactly like the lambda from the logo when written).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 11-8-2008(11): Something only a Native American could pull off instead of saying &quot;Come in please.&quot;. When used as a primitive, instead of<strong> enter</strong>, I use a <strong>tepee</strong> for this character. See my stories up to <a href="../v4/787">sue</a> (#787 訟).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 12-5-2008(8): Note that the printed character and the written character appear very differently.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sdrobertm">sdrobertm</a>] 23-1-2011(3): ***As a primitive, &quot;enter&quot; is far to vague so I will give it meaning of &quot;door knob&quot; which is the first thing we touch when<strong> enter</strong>ing a room or building.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hornlo">hornlo</a>] 14-9-2010(3): [ <strong>enter</strong> ] - just remember it; draw as backslash leaning left on a prop; cf <a href="../v4/8">eight</a> (#8 八), <a href="../v4/951">person</a> (#951 人), <a href="../v4/767">exit</a> (#767 出) : (<em>to come/put/go in</em>, etc.; leave gap at top).
