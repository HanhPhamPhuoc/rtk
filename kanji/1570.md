The reason? Starfleet Command felt that since he wasn&#039;t technically alive they should distinguish that difference by giving him SILVER sigs. Naturally, this created a lot of<strong> resentment</strong> on DATA&#039;s part.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 29-4-2011(3): Regret-- Judas&#039; STATE OF MIND after betraying his Savior for 30 pieces of SILVER out of<strong> resentment</strong>.

She was full of both regret and<strong> resentment</strong> that she couldn&#039;t have it for herself.
