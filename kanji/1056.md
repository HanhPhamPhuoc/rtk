1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 23-8-2007(213): <em>Mr. T</em> is a terrible <strong>spy</strong>. He walks around <em>upright</em>. &quot;Why should I hide?! I&#039;ve got nothing to be ashamed of!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 11-12-2006(142): NOTE: The second primitive is <em>upright</em>, not <em>eminent</em>. There is an error in the book.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 4-1-2008(43): You&#039;re playing I<strong> Spy</strong> with a girl you like. She says &quot;I<strong> spy</strong> with my little eye something standing upright&quot; -<em>you blush</em>- She laughs, &quot;no, I&#039;m talking about the Mr T action figure that&#039;s standing upright behind you...but now that you mention it...&quot; !!!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 19-12-2007(27): A perfect<strong> spy</strong> is a <em>person</em> who is deemed <em>upright</em> in the community.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame">yukkuri_kame</a>] 4-7-2009(12): Palpatine to JEDI Anakin: &quot;They asked you to do something that made you feel less-than-UPRIGHT(dishonest). They asked you to<strong> SPY</strong> on me, didn&#039;t they?&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-12-2007(10): Chuck Norris is so badass, he doesn&#039;t need to hide to<strong> spy</strong> people. He just stands <em>upright</em> and if someone doesn&#039;t act as if he wasn&#039;t here, he knocks him over with a <em>head-kick</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 4-1-2007(8): I think of a cartoon where a <strong>spy</strong> is just a <em>person</em> <em>upright</em> behind a tree, post, etc., hiding from any <em>person</em> passing by.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 1-9-2008(7): <em>Haruhi</em> stands <em>upright</em> against a barrier as she <strong>spies</strong> on someone.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-1-2006(7): During one of his previous less-known jobs, <em>Mister T</em> is an undercover<strong> spy</strong> at a nun convent. Picture Mister T cross dressing as a chaste Nun, this should be memorable. He is also <em>upright</em> in the sense of trying to hold his back straight, because he&#039;s got some sort of device attached in his back, which is linked to a microphone, and if he isn&#039;t <em>upright</em>, a bulge will appear on his back which may give him away.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Texie">Texie</a>] 3-2-2011(6): The perfect <em>spy</em> is a <em>person</em> who looks like an <em>upright</em> citizen.
