heisig: "<i>Pent in</i> . . . <i>Big Dipper</i>. Hint: among the songs dating from the days of slavery that have become part of American folklore is one called &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd.&quot; It referred to the nighttime travel of runaway slaves (those <i>pent in</i>) who had no <b>maps</b> other than the stars to guide them, among them the bright and predominant <i>Big Dipper</i>, the &quot;Drinking Gourd.&quot;"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 16-4-2007(217): Can&#039;t see direct relation to <a href="../v4/1177">Big Dipper</a> (#1177 斗) since its writing order is completely different. As raulir noted, it&#039;s written as overlapping at the last stroke of ツ and the first of メ. I take it as a pictograph or treasure<strong> map</strong>. Two dots represent big trees and the cross (marking the treasure) is placed relative to them.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 27-3-2011(56): A pictograph of a treasure<strong> map</strong>. Two steps east then X marks the spot. 図る はかる attempt, deceive; 地図 ちず<strong> map</strong>; 意図する いとする make a goal, intend to do; 図々しい ずうずうしい impudent, shameless; 図書館 としょかん library.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 20-6-2006(23): When I arrived in Hollywood, I bought what they call a &quot;star<strong> map</strong>.&quot; Much to my dismay, it didn&#039;t even show the location of the <em>big dipper</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 2-5-2007(14): A PENT IN BIG DIPPER is an astronomy<strong> MAP</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold">cingold</a>] 12-10-2009(11): Ahem, it looks like a Trea-<em>tsu me</em>p, er a treasure<strong> map</strong>...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dawhite">dawhite</a>] 25-11-2006(7): A<strong> map</strong> is square, and <em>pent up</em> within it, <em>dot, dot, x</em> marks the spot.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 30-12-2006(6): To me this is just a pictograph of a square<strong> map</strong> with some squiggles drawn on it. Pent in squiggles, if you want. The squiggles are just ツメ ( 詰め , pent in? or 爪 , fingernails?) overlapping at the last stroke of ツ and first of メ.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mavelle">mavelle</a>] 27-2-2011(4): Not written SHI シ like in <a href="../v4/1177">Big Dipper</a> (#1177 斗) but TSU ツ like in TreaSUre<strong> map</strong>. As raulir noted, it&#039;s written as overlapping at the last stroke of ツ and the first of メ. It is as a pictograph of a treasure<strong> map</strong>: Two steps east then X marks the spot. (thanks Robotact &amp; uberclimber).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(3): A<strong> map</strong> of buried (pent-up) treasure. Beside the ツ(two) tree&#039;s, X marks the spot.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 2-7-2011(2): The treasure <strong>map</strong> says: <em>Two steps East</em> -&gt; then &quot;<em>X</em>&quot; marks the spot - the gold will be <em>pent in</em> a chest.
