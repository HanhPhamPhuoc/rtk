1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(399): This is either a love scene or a murder scene that you are seeing through a<strong> window</strong>. The love scene: through the<strong> window</strong> of a house (from a distance), you see a pair of human legs, then elbows, and then some pink hearts floating up like in a cartoon. The murder scene: peering through the<strong> window</strong> of a house, you see a gruesome murder scene. Human legs dangling from a ceiling fan, an elbow sticking out of a wall, and a heart still beating on the carpet.

With nothing better to do, he is looking through the rear <strong>window</strong> with his camera (he needs to use his <em>elbow</em> to support those heavy lenses) until his <em>heart</em> begins to race as he witnesses a murder!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/karmatheif">karmatheif</a>] 8-7-2008(33): The top primitive is similar to <a href="../v4/1316">hole</a> (#1316 穴). A<strong> window</strong> is a <a href="../v4/1316">hole</a> (#1316 穴) in your house that you occassionally sit next to while leaning on your ELBOW and gazing out, a picture of a lonely HEARTedness.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/feldrave">feldrave</a>] 3-11-2009(19): Remember Alice in Wonderland? She was visiting a <em>house</em> when she suddenly got so big that she had to stick her <em>legs</em> and <em>elbows</em> through the<strong> window</strong>s, which made the Queen of <em>Hearts</em> really mad. To put it in order, from top to bottom: a<strong> window</strong> is the part of the <em>house</em> through which Alice stuck her <em>legs</em> and <em>elbows</em>, making the Queen of <em>Hearts</em> mad.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Melamelachan">Melamelachan</a>] 18-12-2009(8): When mini-skirts first came up, my (then already quite aged) great-grandfather used to enjoy sitting in his <em>house</em> and looking out of the<strong> window</strong> at all those <em>human legs</em> that were walking past outside, his <em>heart</em> pounding. When my great-grandmother noticed this, she <em>elbowed</em> him in the ribs, of course!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/philiphoward123">philiphoward123</a>] 3-10-2009(6): Like &quot;Howl&#039;s Moving Castle&quot;, this is a magical <em>house</em> on <em>human legs</em> that can travel around the country doing mischief or helping you prevent it. Next to the bend of its <em>elbow</em> you can see in through the<strong> window</strong> somewhat, and you spy a glimmer of red reflected from the <em>heart</em> within.
