heisig: "To our way of counting directions, the <b>west</b> always comes fourth. So it is convenient to find the character for <i>four</i> in this kanji. But since we want only <i>one</i> of the <i>four</i> directions, the <b>west</b> adds the <i>one</i> at the top and sucks the <i>human legs</i> a bit out of their <i>mouth</i> in the process."
primit: "As a primitive, the meaning of west can be expanded to refer to the Old West of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for east was expanded into the East. Note, however, that in its primitive form the legs are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the mouth. Hence, we get the shape o. With the exception of one kanji, given in the following FRAME, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 9-2-2007(224): The old<strong> west</strong> represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare <a href="../v4/1427">sign of the bird</a> (#1427 酉) whiskey bottle about one third full).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 3-3-2008(49): Note: this kanji is also used to denote Spain.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 22-12-2008(25): The Spaghetti <strong>Western</strong> movies, typified by <em>empty bottles of whisky</em>, were so-called because it was often an Italian director that shot them. Most of these films however, were actually shot in <strong>Spain</strong> (another meaning this kanji holds).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 11-2-2009(21): Only <em>one</em> out of every <em>four</em><strong> west</strong>erns is worth watching. Even that&#039;s debatable. The rest are crap.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akatsukigui">akatsukigui</a>] 24-11-2010(14): <em>One</em> of the <em>four</em> directions: The<strong> West</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-7-2009(8): 1) In English, the <em>one</em> direction listed <em>fourth</em> is<strong> west</strong>. 2) An <em>empty whiskey bottle</em> from the<strong> West</strong> arrived on the shore of Japan, and they thought it was some profound Buddhist message in a bottle, but really it was just the litter of some drunk.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 24-1-2010(3): Primitive: Will Smith as Jim<strong> West</strong> from the movie Wild Wild<strong> West</strong>. Smith drank all the <em>whiskey</em> in the bottle. That&#039;s why we&#039;re missing the line that measures the fluid level.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 9-1-2012(2): Here is a cowboy who has had 4 shots of whiskey! No more whiskey left in the bottle.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jacktaylor">jacktaylor</a>] 4-8-2010(2): As a primitive, this is <strong>Vash the Stampede</strong> from Trigun. The world of Trigun is a lot like the old<strong> west</strong>, and Vash is as sharp-shooting a cowboy as you&#039;ll ever find. Does anyone remember the episode where Vash <em>empties his whiskey bottle</em> several times over and still defeats the bad guys without firing a single shot?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alfonso">Alfonso</a>] 14-7-2010(2): <strong>West</strong> is one of the directions, and it&#039;s the fourth counting from the north.
