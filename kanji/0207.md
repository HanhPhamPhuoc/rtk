heisig: "Here we see a pictograph of a <b>tree</b>, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for <i>water</i> (Frame 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance."
primit: "As a primitive, this kanji can be used to mean tree or wood. In those cases where the last two strokes are detached from the trunk (6), we shall change its meaning to pole, or wooden pole."
