7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/afefer">afefer</a>] 25-2-2010(5): If you&#039;re a <strong>V.I.P.</strong>, you&#039;re <em>one</em> of the <em>few</em> with a <em>house</em> and a lot of <em>money</em>.

All of a sudden a large part of the <em>ceiling</em> comes collapsing down. &quot;Like, that sucks,&quot; Paris says. &quot;I&#039;d, like, offer to pay for a new <em>ceiling</em> for your family and stuff, but unfortunately I only have, like, a <em>few</em> <em>shells</em>.&quot;.
