4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 26-3-2010(11): Often used in shaving lotion and fragrance descriptions 爽やか さわやか refreshing,<strong> bracing</strong>, sweet, clear. Story: Slap some alcohol-based さわやか aftershave lotion onto the <em>4</em> <em>big</em> x-shaped hockey <em>stitches</em> on your face. That&#039;s<strong> bracing</strong>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 1-4-2012(7): If the keyword is supposed to stand for invigorating, why not just make that the keyword? Heisig doesn&#039;t use invigorating, or any variation of invigorate as a keyword, and<strong> bracing</strong> is almost never used to mean invigorating.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mirnkaya">mirnkaya</a>] 26-5-2012(6): (Thanks CasualTatsumaki) <em>one</em> slap of this aftershave on the <em>four stitches</em> you have on your <em>person</em>. That&#039;s<strong> BRACING</strong>/INVIGORATING.... (note: this story follows the right stroke order as well as the actual parts used here which includes one and person).

A yellow one, a red one, a blue one and a green one. There is this one part of the game where they have to work together and carry sleeping St. Bernard through the garden. Look as the 4 wolverines work together,<strong> bracing</strong> the dog to complete the level.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 19-1-2010(2): For a famished person lost in a desolate area the appearance of a ST BERNARD with TWO PAIRS OF SHEAVES is very<strong> BRACING</strong>.
