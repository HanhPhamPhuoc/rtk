1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 14-8-2007(250): Little<strong> boy</strong>s always head in the direction of mud and dirt.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 16-12-2008(52): <strong>Boy</strong>s thoughts often head in dirty directions.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 11-6-2008(30): It&#039;s a <em>dirty</em><strong> BOY</strong>scout, lost in the woods by himself with only his compass for <em>directions</em>. Can&#039;t you just see the lost little<strong> boy</strong>, all alone?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skellyfish">skellyfish</a>] 11-2-2009(16): A<strong> Boy</strong> Scout lost in the woods, all DIRTY and holding a COMPASS, trying to find his way home. Imagine him crying because he&#039;s such a young<strong> boy</strong>, covered with DIRT streaked with tears, and banging his COMPASS against trees, etc. in an attempt to get it to work.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tgray88">tgray88</a>] 4-10-2008(13): A<strong> boy</strong> scout will generally use the <em>ground</em> to determine <em>directions</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matstc">matstc</a>] 4-7-2008(8): Little<strong> boy</strong>s always throw <em>mud</em> in all <em>directions</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 29-6-2009(7): For me the perfect image of a<strong> boy</strong> for this is Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes. He&#039;s the archetypal young<strong> boy</strong> and he loves exploring, in his little explorer hat. He gets <em>mud</em> all over himself and studies his <em>compass</em> gleefully. Go look at one of the panels where he runs out the front door shouting &quot;Summer!&quot; or &quot;Let&#039;s go exploring!&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87">Georgi87</a>] 11-4-2008(5): <strong>Boy</strong>s love dirt, and don&#039;t need a compass to go and find some! (Twist on ihatobu&#039;s story, I just think of physical objects for radicals so &quot;direction&quot; wasn&#039;t helpful).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 17-2-2013(4): Little<strong> boy</strong>s always head in <em>dirt&#039;s</em> <em>direction</em>. (thanks ihatobu).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lazerbeat">Lazerbeat</a>] 8-7-2011(3): When I was a<strong> boy</strong> my thoughts went in DIRTY DIRECTIONS.
