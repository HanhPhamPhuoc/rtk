heisig: "<i>Go in</i> . . . <i>an umbrella</i> . . . <i>a mouth</i>. Because of space restrictions, the element for <i>go in</i> is shortened in this character. If you stand on your head and look at this kanji, the image of a <b>valley</b> stands out more clearly: the <i>mouth</i> of the river whose water flows down at the intersection of the two mountains, with the final two strokes adding the element of perspective. Now get back on your feet again and see if the image still remains clear. If not, then return to the primitives and make a story in the usual way."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 21-2-2007(207): This could be seen as a very accurate pictograph of another type of<strong> valley</strong>: a<strong> valley</strong> <em>mouth</em> open under the <em>umbrella</em> of inner labia, with the outer labia <em>parted</em> above. There are even more connections to be made among the primitive keywords and the visuals, but i will <em>enter</em> no further...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 3-7-2006(81): Think of the classic anime 風の <strong>谷</strong>のナウシカ (Nausicaa of the <em>Valley</em> of the Wind). We see Nausicaa <em>entering</em> the <em>valley</em> <em>mouth</em> gliding on an <em>umbrella</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 13-12-2007(26): <em>Enter</em> the<strong> valley</strong> with an <em>umbrella</em> and your <em>mouth</em> closed the mist is quite throat irritating.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aploosh">Aploosh</a>] 24-6-2007(12): The lines on top (ハ) indicated something being split and two more (ハ) were added underneath to indicate an extra wide split. Also, the ロ means &quot;opening&quot;. Thus, a &quot;widely split opening&quot;, or<strong> VALLEY</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asriel">Asriel</a>] 17-3-2009(10): The<strong> valley</strong> girl needed someone to <em>enter</em> an <em>umbrella</em> into her <em>mouth</em> so she would stop talking!
