heisig: "<i>Mist</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>dry</i>. The meaning of this key word extends beyond <b>tree trunks</b> to represent the main stem or line of anything from railway lines to managerial staffs. This should help distinguish it from the stories used earlier for <i>book</i> (Frame 224) and <i>body</i> (Frame 1030), both of which made use of the image of a <b>tree trunk</b>, as well as the kanji for <i>trunk</i> (Frame 194)."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 12-1-2007(299): A fine <em>mist</em> is falling, and so everyone gathers around near the<strong> tree-trunk</strong>, effectively using the rest of the tree as an <em>umbrella</em> in order to keep <em>dry</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 10-5-2007(64): By astridtops - In the rainy <em>mist</em>, Totoro is standing in front of a<strong> tree-trunk</strong> at the bus stop, under the <em>umbrella</em> he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains <em>dry</em>! Great story...which I get to by thinking:<strong> tree-trunk</strong>-&gt;<strong>TT</strong> -&gt;<strong>T</strong>onari no <strong>T</strong>otoro. I also imagine Mickey Mouse is there too as the KUNyomi for this kanji is みき.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 8-10-2009(22): The word that you will sure see with this kanji is shinkansen (bullet train). 新幹線 . STORY: Shinkansen is very expensive, so I only use it when a MIST is falling. I prefer the train than an UMBRELLA to stay DRY.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 6-2-2008(20): There is no tree in this kanji! So think of a cold, bare, dead<strong> tree-trunk</strong>, with the upper branches all cut off. Residents of the neighboring house have run a <em>clothesline</em> from their window to the dead<strong> tree-trunk</strong>. You are filled with sadness, seeing the greatness of nature being destroyed and exploited by mankind. You are walking by this sad scene on a cold and drizzly day with a fine <em>mist</em> descending, using an <em>umbrella</em> to keep yourself <em>dry</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 22-7-2006(12): In the rainy <em>mist</em>, Totoro is standing in front of a<strong> tree-trunk</strong> at the bus stop, under the <em>umbrella</em> he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains <em>dry</em>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 29-5-2012(7): Note: The literal meaning of &quot;shinkansen&quot; is not &quot;bullet train&quot; but &quot;new trunk line&quot; 新幹線 because it only runs on a few main trunk lines. Regular trains serve all the branch lines to smaller cities.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(7): I&#039;m reading the end of The Giving Tree, where the tree is reduced to just a<strong> tree-trunk</strong>. I get all <em>mist</em>y-eyed, and my friend says &quot;Hey, are you crying??&quot; I say, &quot;No, it&#039;s just the rain...&quot; He quickly replies &quot;But... you have an <em>umbrella</em>... and the rest of you is <em>dry</em>&quot;...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/digicult">digicult</a>] 17-6-2009(7): Anyone waiting in the <em>mist</em> for a train on one of the &quot;<strong>tree-trunk</strong>&quot; lines had better have an <em>umbrella</em> to keep <em>dry</em>. 新幹線 shinkansen.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 17-4-2013(5): Unlike a static<strong> tree-trunk</strong>, the shinkansen ( 新幹線 ) trunk line races through the <em>mist</em>, keeping <em>dry</em> as if sheltered by an <em>umbrella</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 20-6-2010(3): A fine <em>mist</em> is falling, and everyone automatically gathers near the<strong> tree-trunk</strong>, thinking to use the tree as an <em>umbrella</em> in order to keep <em>dry</em>. But they don&#039;t realize that the foliage and branches are gone, it&#039;s just the trunk! [+1 sweetneet, rtkrtk].
