1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 18-3-2007(247): The <em>schoolhouse</em> is the <em>backbone</em> of a foundation that will allow you to find a good<strong> occupation</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-11-2006(87): During the German<strong> occupation</strong>, this Nazi officer&#039;s<strong> occupation</strong> was to manage <em>schools</em> that were requisitioned for training the children of the Aryan race to stand proud with an erect <em>spine</em> (mnemonic : &quot;the<strong> occupation</strong>&#039;s <em>spine schools</em>&quot;). Kanji meanings : to manage, to conduct (business), and also &quot;barracks; camp; encapment&quot;. This story should help avoid confusion with <a href="../v4/824">post</a> (#824 職) and <a href="../v4/1083">employ</a> (#1083 雇). The military<strong> occupation</strong> theme hints to the secondary meaning, e.g. 営倉 &quot;detention barracks&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/walexander5">walexander5</a>] 14-7-2008(56): Stay in <em>school</em> so you can get an<strong> occupation</strong> that doesnt require breaking your <em>backbone</em> all day.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 10-12-2007(23): I get this confused with <a href="../v4/1792">business/profession</a> (#1792 業). An<strong> occupation</strong> is something you can get after you leave the <em>schoolhouse</em> with a <em>backbone</em> of knowledge, but to get a profession you need to move on to higher education.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 19-5-2008(20): ATCHUNG!!! This keyword stands for <strong>Military<strong> occupation</strong></strong>, and not profession, as it could be (incorrectly) assumed from the primitives. Meanings: <strong>Management</strong>, <strong>Military Camp</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 26-2-2009(19): During Military<strong> Occupation</strong>, <em>Shinto Shrines</em> were captured by the invading forces and turned into <em>School Houses</em> to &quot;properly educate&quot; the children on the invaders way of thinking.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-9-2007(7): [+fuaburisu] In the Japanese<strong> occupation</strong> of Iraq (bear with me) it is the<strong> occupation</strong> of certain soldier to go into all the <em>schoolhouses</em> and check the kids&#039; <em>spines</em>. Those who have good posture are forced to take up the <em>occupation</em> of Shinto priests at the local Shinto shrines set up by the occupying Japanese forces for their use.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxg">tritonxg</a>] 12-4-2010(6): [FR]<strong>gestion</strong> N2 <strong>EI itona(mu) </strong>k&amp;kana:722<em> toit d&#039;école+épine dorsale</em><strong> MBA :</strong> il faut s&#039;échiner l&#039;EPINE DORSALE longtemps sous un TOIT D&#039;ECOLE pour avoir un MBA de <strong>GESTION</strong>営業経費【えいぎょうけいひ】operation cost 営業報告 【えいぎょうほうこく】business report 経営管理 【けいえいかんり】<strong>gestion</strong>露営【ろえい】bivouac 野営 【やえい】camping 本営 【ほんえい】QG 軍営 【ぐんえい】military camp 造営費 【ぞうえいひ】construction costs.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 24-9-2007(5): <strong>Occupation</strong>al therapists go to <em>school</em> to learn how to help people overcome <em>spinal</em> injuries. Imagine a classroom full of OT&#039;s massaging patient&#039;s backs.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tenken3">tenken3</a>] 27-4-2007(4): My<strong> occupation</strong>? Cracking children&#039;s spines in school if they don&#039;t behave.
