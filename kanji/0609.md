heisig: "On the left you see the <i>rock</i>, which is familiar enough. But pay attention to the right. Taking careful note of the unusual stroke order that has the &quot;chimney&quot; on the <i>house</i> doubled up with the first stroke of the <i>turkey</i>, we may see the right side as a <i>turkey house</i> (or &quot;<i>coop</i>&quot;).
We shall see this pattern only on one other occasion (Frame 2093), but even for these two characters it is well worth the trouble to single it out as a primitive."
