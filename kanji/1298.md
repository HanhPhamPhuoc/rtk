1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 3-9-2006(297): Before the advent of printers in Japan, typewriters couldn&#039;t be built as they were in the west due to how many kanji there are. Lots of small<strong> printing block</strong>s had to be used instead. <em>One side</em> of the<strong> printing block</strong> would have a mirrored (<em>anti</em>) image of the kanji. This is true.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matsuyamakiwi">matsuyamakiwi</a>] 7-6-2008(71): Nazi propaganda. Picture the <strong>printing blocks</strong> producing very <em>one-sided</em> (Aryan), <em>anti</em>-Jewish propaganda spreading posters to hang around town.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 3-4-2011(59): <strong>Printing block</strong> has a <em>one-sided</em> <em>anti-image</em> of what&#039;s being printed.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 31-5-2006(22): <strong>Printing block</strong>s are one-sided and have &quot;anti-image&quot; of the page carved into them (the background-colored areas are engraved, not the text).

The copyists were able to get away with making slight omissions &amp; changes when they didn&#039;t agree with the source documents, resulting in <strong>one-sided</strong> versions of the original text. The invention of the<strong> printing block</strong> ensured all copies would be identical to the original; thus it is <strong>anti-one-sided</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 10-10-2008(9): In traditional Japanese wood block prints, <em>one side</em> of the<strong> printing block</strong> has an <em>anti</em>, or inverse, image of the design that the artist intends to print.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 4-5-2009(6): <strong>Printing block</strong>s were often used to make propaganda, those <em>one-sided</em> messages that were <em>anti</em>-government.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brendanmacdonald">brendanmacdonald</a>] 10-9-2011(5): Editions of some newspapers are so one-sided and anti the other side.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sir_sanuk">sir_sanuk</a>] 13-1-2011(5): The<strong> printing block</strong>s of Japanese newspapers churn out editions that are <em>one-sided</em> and <em>anti</em>-foreigners.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 31-1-2008(4): So you got the guy proposing but the love is from one side. Dirty Harry didnt like it at all being proposed at by a guy. So he pushes the fellow (with ring or middle finger) under the<strong> printing block</strong> and pushes the start button. splat...
