2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 20-7-2009(77): <strong>Unravel</strong> the mystery by determining at what ANGLE the SWORD went into the COW.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-12-2007(38): I tossed the BOOMERANG, which stuck like a DAGGER into a COW that I targeted. Now I watched the COW&#039;s insides begin to<strong> UNRAVEL</strong> from the cut.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 29-4-2007(19): To <strong>unravel</strong> this mystery, you have to consider it from the right <em>angle</em>. Remember the most important clue: The <em>dagger</em> was found lodged in the stable above the <em>cow</em>&#039;s head! Once you see that <em>angle</em>, who would be able to place the <em>dagger</em> over the <em>cow</em>&#039;s head, the whole puzzle will <strong>unravel</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 25-7-2008(17): Think: Piñata. Specifically, one in the shape of a <em>cow</em> that will completely<strong> unravel</strong> if <em>stabbed</em> at just the right <em>angle</em>.

It was the DAGGER who killed it? or the BOOMERANG that was thrown in the first place? (I guess it was the DAGGER, because the dead cow is under the dagger, remember position).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Seiska">Seiska</a>] 20-2-2011(8): This could be a puzzle from Zelda game. Imagine a room where there&#039;s dagger hanging above a cow, you need to rebound the boomerang from correct angle to drop the dagger and enrage the cow, this of course<strong> unravel</strong>s the puzzle.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-12-2007(7): <strong>Unravel</strong>ing a <em>cow</em>&#039;s clothing. Just cut a small hole on top of the <em>cow</em> with your <em>dagger</em>, tie a small thread to the <em>boomerang</em>, then throw your <em>boomerang</em> as far as you can. The cow will begin to<strong> unravel</strong> (leaving the cow shuddering and clutching its private parts) just like in the cartoons with an added twist - the <em>boomerang</em> will return with a pile of the <strong>unraveled</strong> cow clothing right there at your feet so that you can run out and make your own cowhide car seats!
