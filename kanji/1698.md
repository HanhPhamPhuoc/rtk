1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 16-1-2008(224): Muttering words of gratitude for a wonderful meal, I<strong> discreet</strong>ly slipped my cabbage under the table for the dog.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 10-2-2008(135): <em>Cabbage</em> primitive: When a <em>cabbage</em> is <em>growing up</em>, you must put it in your <em>mouth</em> before it <em>flowers</em>, because that&#039;s when it becomes bitter. Seriously, it&#039;s called &#039;bolting&#039; or something. When you&#039;re<strong> discreet</strong>, you try to make your <em>words</em> like a <em>cabbage</em>: well-layered, but in an unassuming way.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kodorakun">kodorakun</a>] 6-5-2010(55): HOW TO REMEMBER CABBAGE: it&#039;s the flower that is shoved in your mouth while you are growing up (parents force feed you cabbage), note how the &quot;grow up&quot; primitive is pushed into the mouth primitive overlapping. &quot;Muttering words of gratitude for a wonderful meal, I<strong> discreet</strong>ly slipped my cabbage under the table for the dog.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 27-12-2006(37): Be<strong> discreet</strong> and don&#039;t say to old people that their heads look like cabbages, even if they&#039;re all wrinkles.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 5-1-2009(26): Instead of cabbage here I see the Piranha Plant from Super Mario bros. It&#039;s a flower with a mouth and it grows up out of a pipe! Seems to make sense to me. But instead of regular Mario you have Socrates! So here is what is going on. Two Piranha Plants are<strong> discreet</strong>ly discussing when they will come up out of their pipes to hit Socrates. They have to talk<strong> discreet</strong>ly however becuase Socrates is standing right next to their pipes.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 20-3-2008(11): You mail-order some &quot;toys&quot; that you don&#039;t want your postman/neighbors to know about. The advertisement promises &quot;discreet packaging! No one but you will know what&#039;s inside.&quot; The package arrives in a plain brown paper box with no <em>words</em> on the outside - very<strong> discreet</strong> indeed. And, what&#039;s more, when you open the package, you see a <em>cabbage</em>. The &quot;toys&quot; are hidden inside the cabbage for another layer of<strong> discreet</strong>ness.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 13-6-2006(11): Kids in the Hall. Cabbage Head. Imagine him saying in a loud obnoxious voice after everyone is staring at him in the restaurant, &quot;It&#039;s hard to be<strong> discreet</strong> when you have a cabbage for a head.&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 28-8-2010(10): Be careful when writing the <em>cabbage</em> primitive, the stroke order of <em>grow up</em> is changed (the vertical stroke is written first). If it makes it easier, think of it as <em>walking stick</em> and <em>three</em>. Primitive story: Cauli<em>flower</em> and <strong>cabbage</strong> in your <em>mouth</em> everyday keeps the <em>walking stick</em> away, eat them <em>three</em> times a day!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fergal">fergal</a>] 21-7-2009(8): You&#039;re trying to be <strong>discreet</strong> at dinner so you write <em>words</em> on a <em>cabbage</em> leaf and pass that to your friend to tell them something <strong>discreetly</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 1-5-2009(7): !!!!WARNING!!!! USE DISCRETION IF YOUR CABBAGE TALKS BACK TO YOU!!!!
