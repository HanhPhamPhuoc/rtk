So, a small elephant&#039;s<strong> bud</strong>s (nubs) become tusks later, but for now they are &quot;buds&quot;, which brings up the association with flowers. &quot;The <em>bud</em>ding tusks - actually &#039;nubs&#039; became a focal point in this my first sculpture.&quot; <a href="http://www.paintingsofwildlife.com/sculpture.html">http://www.paintingsofwildlife.com/sculpture.html</a>.
