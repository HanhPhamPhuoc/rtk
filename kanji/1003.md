So, going with the law idea, in the legal system where everything is made of <em>wood</em>, (the bench, the hammer, the books, the jury box) and the lawyers are running around wearing <em>sheep</em> wool (in UK and AU court), they argue about miniscule points that have as much importantance as a <em>grain of rice</em> in the whole scheme of things.
