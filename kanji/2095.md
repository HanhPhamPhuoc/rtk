1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-5-2006(166): In the jungle there is a flowery<strong> vine</strong> called hedera rhombea that attracts humming birds by the dozens. They scoot around the flowers sucking up nectar off the<strong> vine</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(104): Note : if you&#039;ll remember we already have a primitive for &quot;ivy&quot;, but it was completely made up from the &quot;square jewel&quot; kanji. The kanji here refers to ivy, or<strong> vine</strong>, and is used in a particular compound for &quot;Hedera rhombea&quot;, which is a type of ivy native to Japan. This<strong> vine</strong> here produces a lot of flowers, and attracts many small birds, which is sure to cheer up even the most depressed Japanese gardener.
