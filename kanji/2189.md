3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 30-1-2007(44): <em>drop</em> your <em>shovels</em> and put them neatly on the <em>hooks</em>...it&#039;s time to head back to the<strong> barracks</strong> ...now move it!!!!!!!!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Garland">Garland</a>] 12-9-2012(8): Because of Obama&#039;s calm intelligence, well developed speaking skills and the great hype he caused on the internet, it was clear that McCain would be crushed like a <em>worm</em> and the victory would be <strong>Barack&#039;s</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-1-2006(4): Back on page 371 of the book, I had no idea what the primitives were about, but I finally got it : it&#039;s not just the <em>fishhook</em>, I think Heisig hinted at : if you turn over some soil with the <em>shovel</em>, you will find <em>drops</em> in it (the <em>earthworms</em>), which you can then use on a <em>fishhook</em>. As for<strong> barracks</strong>, the kanji refers to army<strong> barracks</strong>. If you played the computer game &quot;Worms&quot;, you can easily imagine the<strong> barracks</strong> where they sleep, after having at each other with rocket launchers, grenades and whatnot :).
