heisig: "A <i>sword</i> or <i>dagger</i> posed over a <i>mouth</i> is how the character for &quot;beckoning&quot; is written. The related but less tame key word <b>seduce</b> was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the - how shall we put it? - Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is <b>seducing</b> the small round one or vice versa.)"
primit: "The primitive meaning remains the same: SEDUCE. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image. SIMPLE When you seduce a girl you can put your sword in her mouth."
