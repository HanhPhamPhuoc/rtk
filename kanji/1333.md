8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 3-2-2011(2): A man-eating alien with <em>two mouths</em>---he hides <em>one</em> with a beard that&#039;s really a <em>snare</em>, and when he goes to eat people, his whole <em>head</em> flips back at the<strong> chin</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-5-2009(2): The left part looks like a picture for me (okay, maybe I hallucinate, but try it): <em>two eyes</em>, a <em>nose</em> (the horizontal stroke) and the <em>snare</em> depicting the<strong> chin</strong>: an open mouth, as if loughing out loud.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tguk911">tguk911</a>] 3-12-2012(1): The man got surgery on his <em>head</em> and got a wider<strong> chin</strong> so he could install another mouth. The <em>two mouths</em> share one <em>tongue</em> though cause he didn&#039;t have enough money to buy another one. But since he has another mouth he can en<em>snare</em> double the amount of food that he used to.
