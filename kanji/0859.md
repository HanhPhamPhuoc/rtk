heisig: "Outhouse . . . shellfish."
primit: "outhouse The combination of the element for little, the basic &quot;roof&quot; structure here (in which the chimney was overwritten, as it was in the element for vulture), combined with the &quot;window&quot; (mouth) below, gives this element its meaning of outhouse. Although the window is not an essential part of an outhouse, I think you will agree that its inclusion is a boon to the imagination, greatly simplifying the learning of the characters in which it appears.

A<strong> prize</strong> entail a rise in social esteem and some money.......... 賞 = しょう = award.
