1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 28-6-2012(209): The schools that accepted them were posted on a TREE, the students MINGLED around trying to find their names. (コオ）.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JetSetArnett">JetSetArnett</a>] 12-3-2009(136): Note: this Kanji does <em>not</em> mean<strong> exam</strong>. It means school. I find this keyword an choice odd as <strong>school</strong> by itself is not used elsewhere.<strong> Exam</strong>ples: 校長 is principal (lit. school chief); 中学校 is junior high school (lit. middle study/knowledge school).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 31-12-2007(63): Ninja school<strong> exam</strong>: <em>Mingle</em> with the <em>trees</em>. If the teacher can spot you, you fail.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akahige">akahige</a>] 14-4-2009(40): Note: this Kanji does <em>not</em> mean<strong> exam</strong>. It means school. I find this keyword an choice odd as <strong>school</strong> by itself is not used elsewhere.<strong> Exam</strong>ples: 校長 is principal (lit. school chief); 中学校 is junior high school (lit. middle study/knowledge school). To add to JetSetArnett&#039;s: at the <em>school</em>, the <strong>trees</strong> outside are a popular place for the students to <strong>mingle</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow">cornrow</a>] 5-12-2008(37): I &quot;<em>WOOD MINGLE</em>&quot;, but I have an<strong> exam</strong>. Ha ha ha.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus">findus</a>] 4-6-2009(28): To avoid the confusion with <a href="../v4/1673">examination</a> (#1673 検) and <a href="../v4/354">test</a> (#354 試), let&#039;s use rhymes: The school just posted on a <em>tree</em> / the results of the big<strong> exam</strong>. / Students <em>mingle</em> around to see / &quot;was it worth it to cram ?&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 26-11-2008(11): School is composed of two parts: Learning（ 学 ）and<strong> exam</strong>s （ 校 ）. School = 学校 .

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-2-2008(9): (richcoop)With the<strong> exam</strong> scores posted on a TREE, the students MINGLED around looking at the results. It was Darth Vader with his top hat that posted the scores of who will become the next Sith.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nagisa">nagisa</a>] 20-1-2008(6): Imagine your horror, when writing an<strong> exam</strong> , when you look up and through the window see your father (still in his mingling clothes) sitting up in a tree waving a sign that says &quot;good luck!!!&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theich">theich</a>] 14-12-2009(5): In der Baum<strong>schule</strong> lernt man den <em>Umgang</em> mit <em>Bäumen</em>.
