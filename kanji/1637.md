heisig: "This kanji is the 12th sign of the Chinese zodiac: the <b>sign of the hog</b>. It is best learned by thinking of an acorn-eating <b>hog</b> in connection with the primitive meaning given below."
primit: "The top hat represents the external shape of the acorn, and the unusual but easily written complex of strokes beneath it (which you might also see as distortions of an elbow and person) stands for the mysterious secret whereby the acorn contains the oak tree in a nutshell."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5">Floatingweed5</a>] 20-11-2007(193): A greedy hog in a top hat who has eaten all of the acorns. He even elbows people out of the way to get them.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 8-10-2008(39): Top Hat + Elbow + Person: The<strong> sign of the hog</strong> was a very recognizable tattoo - a hog with a big grin in a <em>top hat</em>, sticking his <em>elbow</em> into the <em>person</em> next to him.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/roundrabbit">roundrabbit</a>] 8-9-2009(26): This is easy, if you know Mr. Peanut, the logo of Planters. Replace his face or body with an acorn and you have Mr. Acorn, the logo /<strong> sign of the hog</strong>. He wears the same <em>top hat</em>, has the same turned out <em>elbow</em> holding a diagonal <em>walking stick</em>, and poses like a <em>human</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tobberoth">Tobberoth</a>] 25-11-2008(18): Warning: Stroke order in book is wrong. The top hat should be written as normal.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 8-6-2007(13): Q: What is the difference between a pig and a hog? A: A hog is the generic term for all swine. Pigs are immature hogs weighing less than 125 pounds. Other swine related terms include the following: Piglet: a baby swine less than ten weeks old (nursing pig) Sow: a female pig that has had a litter Boar: a male hog (with tusks?).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 4-11-2007(10): As you&#039;ll be using this for ACORN, remember that the best<strong> SIGN OF THE HOG</strong> is alot of missing ACORNS. For ACORN, you can see it HAT cap, with the COCOON under the cap, that a PERSON (likely a kid that pulled off the cap) looking at it.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xingji">xingji</a>] 21-12-2009(8): Can&#039;t believe no one mentioned Porco Rosso before! a TOP HATTED HOG / PERSON who can really use his ELBOWS in a tight fight! - Miyazaki doesn&#039;t show it in the movie but he&#039;s just crazy for ACORNS.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezy99991">ezy99991</a>] 5-5-2012(7): For those of you who have read the book &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. A sure sign that the leading hog has been corrupted is that he&#039;s starts wearing <em>top hats</em>, contributes very little <em>elbow</em> grease and is acting like a lazy human <em>person</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 6-3-2011(4): An acorn-eating <strong>hog</strong>. The kanji shows the <em>cap</em> of the <em>acorn</em>, and the bent <em>elbows</em> of the <em>people</em> who scatter the acorns for the hogs to eat. Could also be the name of a pub where upper-class, <em>top-hat</em>-wearing <em>people</em> go to let their hair down and act low-class and dissolute. See their bent <em>elbow</em>s raising pints? 亥 い twelfth sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Boar); 亥月 がいげつ tenth month of the lunar calendar; 亥年 いどし; いのししどし year of the boar.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 3-2-2008(4): The last two strokes look like that for 人 (person). STORY: Mr. T (or a PERSON) just caught a wild HOG and is carrying him home on his back with his ELBOWS sticking up. Since it is a sweaty task, the PERSON lays his TOP HAT on the HOG as he carries it. The forest creatures (like squirrels) hold the HOG in high regard since he has his own kanzi, and throw ACORNS at the PERSON.
