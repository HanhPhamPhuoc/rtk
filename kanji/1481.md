2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 7-3-2006(43): <strong>How many</strong> went to the party? Two aliens and one person (I feel sorry for that person).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Justin42">Justin42</a>] 20-8-2009(33): It is a little awkward when you are at a <em>fiesta</em> and the host serves some rare delicacy, like moth <em>cocoons</em>, the guests must decide <strong>how many</strong> it would be polite to eat. You do the math in your head and it comes out to two <em>cocoons</em> per <em>person</em>. This is why the horizontal line is a fraction bar with two <em>cocoons</em> on the top, and one <em>person</em> the bottom.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 27-2-2007(18): There&#039;s a <em>cocoon</em> on each side of the entrance to the <em>fiesta</em> that can detect when a person crosses the threshold. They are the two <em>cocoon</em>s that determine <strong>how many</strong> people are attending the fiesta. So<strong> how many</strong> were there? The answer is displayed on an <strong>abacus</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MRT88">MRT88</a>] 30-11-2009(16): At the Mexican <em>fiesta</em>, there is a <em>cocoon</em> eating competition.<strong> How many</strong> <em>cocoons</em> can <em>Mr.T</em> eat? Mr.T currently holds the record at two. Took misha&#039;s and edited for Mr. T purposes.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 27-8-2011(6): <strong>How many</strong> <em>cocoons</em> can one <em>person</em> eat at the <em>fiesta</em>? So far, no one has eaten more than <em>two cocoons</em>....

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ReVoLynx">ReVoLynx</a>] 16-6-2011(5): (I&#039;m using &quot;spear&quot; instead of &quot;fiesta&quot;) A person is trying to count<strong> how many</strong> cocoons there are, using a spear to point them out. Huh, there&#039;s 2, it seems!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kamikettu">Kamikettu</a>] 26-12-2010(5): (+dingomick, crayonmaster, happyjolteon) There&#039;s a <em>Metapod</em> on each side of the entrance to the <em>fiesta</em> that can detect when a person crosses the threshold. They are the two Pokémon trained to determine<strong> how many</strong> people are attending the fiesta. &quot;So<strong> how many</strong> people were there?&quot; he asks both of the Pokémon and tracks the answers with an <em>abacus</em>. While the <em>Metapods</em> are distracted <em>Mr. T</em> slips by... Unnoticed, of course.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 28-4-2007(5): <em>Mr. T</em> is the bouncer at a happening <em>fiesta</em>. There are <em>two cocoons</em> hanging, one behind him and one in front. If anyone is giving him problems he just snaps his fingers, and enormous bugs break out of the cocoons and devour the troublemaker, while Mr. T adds another tally to the <strong>abacus</strong>. This makes it easy when the police ask<strong> how many</strong> people have been eaten so far.
