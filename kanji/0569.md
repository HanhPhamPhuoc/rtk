heisig: "Bind up . . . snake."
primit: "The primitive meaning of wrap should always be used with the snake in mind to avoid confusion with similar terms. Just let &quot;wrap&quot; mean &quot;with a snake coiled about it.&quot;"

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/burritokun">burritokun</a>] 28-8-2008(22): <strong>Wrap</strong> it before you tap it (wrap what? your <em>snake</em>, of course...).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 13-7-2010(4): <strong>Wrap</strong>! The principal attack of snake pokemon such as ekans. The <em>snake</em> pokemon <em>binds</em> up its opponent. Very frustrating if you are its opponent, as you will remember from the game. It does 2-5 lots of damage and then more damage at the end of each turn until they escape (depending on game version). RTK2 #95, pure group, ホウ.
