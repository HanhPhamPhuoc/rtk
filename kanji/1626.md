heisig: "Mouth . . . cornucopia."
primit: "cornucopia Considering the lack of circular lines, this kanji is not a bad pictograph of a cornucopia. Despite the appearance of the printed form, what looks like the first two strokes are actually written as one. [2]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(243): There was a man in a village who had a special gift : whenever he<strong> shout</strong>ed and screamed, his mouth became a cornucopia, overflowing with fruits and food of all sorts. Many of the locals thought he was a cruel man, always screaming at his wife, until they realised he was in fact very kind, and his gift brought prosperity to his family.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 28-8-2006(133): You can hold a CORNUCOPIA up to your MOUTH (like a megaphone) to<strong> SHOUT</strong> lounder. Also notice that the shape of CORNUCOPIA implies the<strong> shout</strong>s are 4 letter words.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 24-10-2007(57): FOUR!! like in golf, someone<strong> shout</strong>s four and you see the golf ball right in front of you.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 19-3-2008(47): <strong>Note</strong>: the <em>cornucopia</em> primitive is not described adequately in Heisig. It has 3 strokes as opposed to 2 as mentioned in the book, but on the left may have 2 or 3 depending on who you ask... Also, on the left, the long stroke is written first. See <a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=921">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=921</a> and <a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=185">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=185</a> for more.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 3-10-2006(27): Your <em>mouth</em> is used <em>4</em><strong> shout</strong>ing.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 16-7-2009(13): From the golfer&#039;s <em>mouth</em> he<strong> shout</strong>s &quot;<em>four!&quot;</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 14-5-2009(11): &quot;We-e-E-e-E-e-E-ell, You know you make me wanna<strong> shout</strong> Hold my hands up and<strong> shout</strong>, Kick my heels up and<strong> shout</strong> Throw my head back and<strong> shout</strong>, Come on now,<strong> shout</strong>...&quot; sings Johnny O&#039;Keefe. But at this concert, every time he &quot;throws his head back and&quot; opens his <em>mouth</em>, he vomits up a <em>cornucopia</em> of fruit and vegetables - apples, bunches of grapes, watermelons, pumpkins, cucumbers, tomatoes and grain. &quot;Kick my heels up and BLAAARRGH!&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 17-12-2008(11): When <em>Ben</em> from the <em>Fantastic 4</em> opens his <em>mouth</em>, you know he&#039;s about to<strong> shout</strong>... probably at Johnny. (As a primitive, I take the right-most element to mean <em>the Fantasic 4</em>).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinsen">shinsen</a>] 14-11-2012(7): &quot;Shout,<strong> shout</strong>, let it all <strong>叫t</strong>&quot; - Tears <em>4</em> Fears.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gilch">gilch</a>] 2-9-2010(7): Hint: if you can&#039;t remember the order of the primitives, note that the &#039;o&#039; comes before the &#039;u&#039; in<strong> shout</strong>.
