heisig: "These are the same <b>carp</b> you see in Japanese &quot;<b>carp</b> streamers.&quot; Only here we find a small home <i>computer</i> or two strung on the line by a father anxious for his son not only to have the courage and determination of a <b>carp</b> swimming upstream, but also the efficiency and memory of a <i>computer</i>. Ugh."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 29-9-2007(224): Japanese<strong> carp</strong> are massive <em>fish</em> - they are measured in <em>ri</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/colonel32">colonel32</a>] 11-10-2006(133): Robo<strong>carp</strong>!!! Part <em>fish</em>, part <em>computer</em>! Visualise him flapping and clanking down the street, with bullets richoting off his scaly armour.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Branduil">Branduil</a>] 3-3-2006(79): The fish got<strong> carp</strong>al tunnel syndrome from the computer(I know it&#039;s lame but it&#039;s hard to find a good story for this).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gringozolano">gringozolano</a>] 5-4-2008(31): In front of my <strong>parents&#039; home</strong> is a <strong>fish</strong> pond full of <em>carp</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 9-5-2008(16): Microsoft, that <em>fishy</em> <em>computer</em> company, borrowed the name of the<strong> carp</strong> <em>fish</em> for their Cache Array Routing Protocol (<strong>CARP</strong>), a fact that only <em>computer</em> nerds are likely to know. Just think of a <em>fishy</em> <em>computer</em> company that makes <strong>crap</strong>py software.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lazar">lazar</a>] 28-5-2008(13): The<strong> carp</strong> is a FISH that travels a long distance measured in Japanese Ri&#039;s.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 19-12-2007(12): If you gave the meaning &quot;House of the Fathers&quot; to the primitive <a href="../v4/173">ri</a> (#173 里), this kanji will be a piece of cake. Chinese myths tell that adult <strong>carps</strong> can swim up a waterfall, so that they can return to the <em>House of their Fathers</em>.
