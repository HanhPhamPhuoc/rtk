heisig: "This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for <i>stand up</i>. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done."
primit: "The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears beneath its relative primitive, the top two strokes are omitted, and the first horizontal stroke is doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it, wherever possible: o. atop its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced below the primitive’s bottom line: p. We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to upside down in a row."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 8-6-2007(290): This is a simplification of 竝, a ideogram of <em>two</em> people <em>standing</em> in a<strong> row</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 12-1-2006(53): Hint : as a primitive I use the image of a<strong> row</strong>ing boat. In a<strong> row</strong>ing boat people sit in<strong> row</strong>s, but also side-by-side (another meaning of the kanji), working together (yet another meaning of this kanji). Note : there will also be a kanji for &quot;rowboat&quot; coming at frame 1876. The<strong> row</strong>ing boat is associated with the sport, and is a primitive, while the kanji for &quot;rowboat&quot; has a generic meaning of &quot;a small boat&quot;. In any case, the kanji for &quot;rowboat&quot; will not appear as a primitive in the book.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bkvogel">bkvogel</a>] 17-9-2008(37): Roman numeral II with 2<strong> row</strong>s of animal horns.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 18-7-2009(22): <strong>Full form:</strong> The image of a <em>viking longboat</em> has the advantage of being both a pictograph and lending to the idea of <em>rowing</em>. <strong>Flattened form:</strong> Here, we simply take the action of <em>rowing</em>, already reinforced by the previous image. <strong>Upside-down-in-a-row form:</strong> The horns on the top of this form follows the other forms as an image of a <em>Viking Berserker</em> with his horned helmet.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 14-7-2007(15): Pictograph of the standing<strong> row</strong> in a theatre. // Primitive: a<strong> row</strong> of standing penguins (since they can&#039;t sit). If it&#039;s in the top position, the penguins are in a<strong> row</strong> in a balcony above the stage. If it&#039;s in the bottom position, the penguins are in the front<strong> row</strong>, lower than the stage. If the top 3 strokes are moved to the bottom (&quot;upside down in a<strong> row</strong>&quot;), then the penguins are in a<strong> row</strong> doing headstands.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 10-7-2009(4): Moviegoers sit in<strong> row</strong>s on the opening day of Star Wars <em>II</em>, the <em>horny</em> ones eager to leave <em>drops</em> when Queen Amadala comes on screen. (This kanji even looks kinda like Darth Maul. I&#039;ll give it the primitive meaning <em>Star Wars</em>, and once the horny bastards leave, it&#039;ll just be a <em>movie theater</em>).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happychair">happychair</a>] 20-5-2006(4): To make a<strong> ROW</strong> of HORNED ANIMALS, use a couple of WALKING STICKS to coax them, but watch out for their DROPpings on the FLOOR.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 13-1-2012(2): <strong>Row</strong>..? This ain&#039;t no<strong> row</strong> it be the Mighty Morphin&#039; Power Rangers! When it be on top... it be their Megazord... when it be in the middle, its thier Dinozords all in a<strong> row</strong> and when you see the kanji like it is here... it be them kicking ass in human form... &quot;<em>GO GO POWER RANGERS!!!</em>&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 16-10-2010(2): 並 へい hey hey hey hey hey ... <a href="http://google.com/#q=並並並並並。。。">並並並並並。。。</a> sing it ... all lined up in a<strong> row</strong>. also: 並木 なみき road side trees lined up、 並ぶ ならぶ to line up.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 19-8-2009(2): I also use <strong>two penguins</strong> as the primitive. However, when it&#039;s on top with the weird shape it will specifically be <strong>Penpen</strong> from Evangelion (as a warm-water penguin, he&#039;s slightly different). Note: this is the kanji for stand twice and combined.
