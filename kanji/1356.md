1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 18-4-2008(271): In a<strong> CRAMPED</strong> space, a brave man holds off PACK OF WILD DOGS with only a pair of SCISSORS.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 23-9-2007(65): A <em>pack of wild dogs</em>, waiting in a very<strong> cramped</strong> waiting room, to get their hair cut by <em>Edward Scissors Hands</em>, who is very popular.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-9-2007(57): It&#039;s far too <em>cramped</em> on the train. You see that there is a guy with a <em>pack of wild dogs</em>, held only by a ribbon. You saunter up to him, and as the train doors open, you casually snip the ribbon with your <em>scissors</em>. Sensing that they are free, the <em>pack of wild dogs</em> spring into action and chase everyone on the car out, including their owner. A few people may get mangled, but hey, at least you&#039;re not so<strong> cramped</strong> anymore - in fact, you&#039;ve got the whole car to yourself.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 29-9-2006(22): Pack of wild dogs in a<strong> cramped</strong> little room waiting to get a haircut from the barber (who uses scissors).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 26-5-2009(12): Etymology of right half = 夾 (Type 1 Phonetic) (be pressed between). Interesting? <a href="../v4/1265">gorge</a> (#1265 峡) <a href="../v4/1266">cramped</a> (#1266 狭) <a href="../v4/1267">sandwiched</a> (#1267 挟). Very directly related to the meaning of these three kanji.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 22-12-2008(11): Imagine being<strong> cramped</strong> in an elevator with a bunch of wild dogs. There are so many you need to use scissors to trim their wild hair to make some room.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bexinkyushu">bexinkyushu</a>] 22-3-2011(7): In Japanese pet shops, <em>packs of dogs</em> are kept<strong> cramped</strong> together in cages. I hated seeing such a thing, so one day I just got a big pair of <em>scissors</em> and cut the cages open. Dogs shouldn&#039;t be<strong> cramped</strong> up like that!! (I really would like to do this).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 14-5-2009(4): <em>Homer on skateboard</em> was chased by a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> and felt<strong> cramped</strong> afterwards.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 24-7-2008(4): For the radical on the right, I suggest using <em>zipper</em> instead of <em>scissors</em> (chosen by Heisig merely because it slighty looks like one). Left one is a furry animal, like a <em>kangaroo</em>, which uses a <em>zipper</em> on his <strong>cramped</strong> bag so that its baby doesn&#039;t fall from a high jump.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 13-12-2007(4): A <em>pack of wild dogs</em> cut my hair last time, which really<strong> cramped</strong> my style, so this time I used a pair of <em>scissors</em>.
