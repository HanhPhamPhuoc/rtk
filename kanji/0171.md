heisig: "&quot;What is <b>time</b>?&quot; asked St. Augustine in his memoirs. &quot;Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you.&quot; Here we have the kanji's answer to that perennial riddle. <b>Time</b> is a <i>sun</i> rising over a <i>Buddhist temple</i>. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character."
