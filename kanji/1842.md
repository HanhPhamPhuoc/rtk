heisig: "<i>Person</i> . . . <i>pup tent</i>. Choose some connotation of the key word that will keep it distinct for you from <i>companion</i> (Frame 19), <i>friend</i> (Frame 760), <i>consort</i> (Frame 1287), and <i>comrade</i> (Frame 1765)."
primit: "pup tent The St. Bernard dog and its overlapping with the element for teepee are enough to suggest the meaning of this primitive element: a pup tent. The combination of sun and little at the bottom can mean a little opening or flap through which the sun shines in the morning to let you know it’s time for getting up. [12]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 18-6-2009(134): Trivia: The right primitive is <em>kagaribi</em> - 尞 - <em>fuel used for sacrifices</em>. I would use <em>sacred bonfire</em> as a primitive . (Mnemonic: Top is a merged image of <em>big</em> and <em>fire</em> - <em>big sacred bonfire</em> that looks like <em>little sun</em>). Story: Your<strong> colleague</strong> got fired literally... in a <em>sacred bonfire</em> by Mr.T.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 16-2-2007(100): Some businesses allow pets in the office. Here, my<strong> colleague</strong> is <em>Mr T</em> and he set up a little <em>pup tent</em> for his minidog, then turns around and completes his TPS reports.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 26-6-2006(80): Mr. T began working in a japanese compagny. As he sees that his<strong> colleague</strong> accept to do some extra work during the week-end and even sleep at the office, he says to them: &quot;I pity da fool who work during week-end! You might as well install a pup tent in the office and forget about your home&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 11-6-2008(20): (リョウ) When Ned (<em>insert male person here</em>) gets a <em>pup tent</em> (i.e. a woody), he calls it his &quot;colleague.&quot; (again, sorry for the crudeness of many of my stories).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 30-9-2006(15): A<strong> colleague</strong> implies someone that you share work with, such as in your company or profession, etc. Here your<strong> colleague</strong> helps you to erect your <em>pup tent</em> during a company outing. Note: <strong>Heisig&#039;s warning</strong> to keep this distinct from other similiar kanji such as <a href="../v4/19">companion</a> (#19 朋), <a href="../v4/704">friend</a> (#704 友), <a href="../v4/1203">consort</a> (#1203 伴) and <a href="../v4/1637">comrade</a> (#1637 輩). That is why I chose to have the <em>person</em> element pictured as someone (the<strong> colleague</strong> in this case) helping with the work of building the <em>pup tent</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 27-2-2012(8): <em>Chuck Norris</em>&#039;s new crime-fighting<strong> colleague</strong>, a St. Bernard puppy here shown sleeping in his <em>pup tent</em>. ------ (Now using Picard so will add story here). Although it wasn&#039;t <em>Picard</em>, I think <em>Archer</em> had a pet beagle. Anyway, imagining <em>Picard</em> with a pet <em>St. Bernard</em> puppy for a<strong> colleague</strong> (No. 2?) should hopefully stick.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vengeorgeb">vengeorgeb</a>] 3-5-2009(8): <em>Mr. T</em> was caught cheating with a<strong> colleague</strong> while they were supposedly &quot;working extra hours&quot;. Now he has to spend the night out in the <em>pup tent</em> while Mrs. T figures out what to do with him.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 16-8-2009(4): Primitive: I take <em>pup tent</em> to mean <em>albino</em> - those people who can only bare a <em>little sun</em>, with <em>large horns</em> hidden from sight to disguise the fact that they are in fact Satan&#039;s spawn. // Story: <em>Luke Skywalker</em> makes every effort to avoid his <em>albino</em><strong> colleague</strong>. Those red eyes just freak him out.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 10-7-2009(4): <em>Haruhi</em> uses an <em>incubator</em> (warm like the <em>sun</em> in order to make <em>little</em> things <em>big</em> and <em>fuzzy</em>) to try and clone some<strong> colleague</strong>s for her club.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lecz0r">lecz0r</a>] 23-2-2011(3): [Primitive 尞: To sacrifice with firewood. Ideogrammic compound: 眘 (“serious”) + 火 (“fire”) BURNT AT THE STAKE] MR T dislikes his<strong> COLLEAGUE</strong>S, honestly he&#039;d like to see them BURNT AT THE STAKE... which isn&#039;t very nice.
