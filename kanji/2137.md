9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h">dat5h</a>] 11-7-2009(7): Interestingly, there is a ward in Tokyo called 練馬区 (ねりまく). One of the prevailing theories of the origin of it&#039;s name is that it was a place for keeping and training horses during the 江戸時代 . It has lot of farmland smack dab in the middle (north west, really) of Tokyo (trust me, I live there). I suppose the samurai or nobility would<strong> drive</strong> their <em>horses</em> up to this <em>ward</em> when they needed to train, or perhaps put the horse to rest. I&#039;ll let you fill in the gaps.
