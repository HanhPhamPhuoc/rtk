heisig: "Although we did not make note of it at the time, the kanji for <i>dog</i> is also a low-grade term for a spy. And later (Frame 1517) we will meet another association of criminals with <i>dogs</i>. The <b>prison</b> here depicts a <i>pack of wild dogs</i> (the long-timers and hardened criminals) into which the poor little c<i>hihuahua</i> (first offender) has been cast. The only thing he has to protect himself against the pack are his shrill and frightened <i>words</i>."
