1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 5-3-2007(153): The REVOLVING wheels of the car (with<strong> REVOLVE</strong>R blaring on the stereo) kicked up RISING CLOUDS of dust.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/komodo">komodo</a>] 20-6-2008(125): Just a note to remember the <em>cloud</em> primative: The name of Goku&#039;s pet <em>cloud</em> that he used to help him rise (fly) in the Dragonball anime series (and also the scientific name for a certain type of cloud) is <em>Nimbus</em> [ <a href="http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/dbztlog/screen2.jpg">http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/dbztlog/screen2.jpg</a> ]. The katakana-ization of this is <strong>ニム</strong>バス, so the <em>rising cloud</em> primative is just an abbreviation of that name written from top to bottom in the old Japanese style.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 24-12-2008(62): Burnout! As the car&#039;s wheels <em>revolve</em> the rubber burns making a <em>rising cloud</em> of smoke!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 10-11-2005(15): You could just think of someone smoking their tires before taking off. They&#039;re staying in one place, but the wheels of the car keep revolving round and round as a cloud of burnt rubber rise from them. To keep distinct from rotation (1046), think of rpms (revolutions per minute).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/philiphoward123">philiphoward123</a>] 16-6-2009(11): The <em>car</em>&#039;s wheels<strong> revolve</strong>, sending up a <em>rising cloud</em> of dust.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73">zardoz73</a>] 4-8-2008(9): In Back to the Future, Doc Brown puts the brakes on the DeLorean by remote control. He revs the gas, and the back wheels of the CAR begin to<strong> revolve</strong>. RISING CLOUDS of smoke from the burnt rubber are released from the revolving tires. 88 miles per hour!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 3-8-2010(5): Drive-by shooting with<strong> revolve</strong>r concludes as the wheels of the car<strong> revolve</strong>, kicking up a rising cloud of dust. (do not confuse with <a href="../v4/1046">rotation</a> (#1046 旋)).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fjolnir">fjolnir</a>] 18-12-2009(5): The <strong>revolving</strong> tires of a <em>car</em> leave behind nothing but a <em>rising cloud</em> of dust..

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bluestocking">bluestocking</a>] 23-3-2008(4): To distinguish from rotation 旋 : remember this kanji means to turn around, change. The get-away CAR kicked up RISING CLOUDS of dust as it did a sharp turn to<strong> REVOLVE</strong> around to escape the police car. 転売 [てんばい] resale 転向 [てんこう] conversion, shift, about-face, switch 転校 [てんこう] change schools.
