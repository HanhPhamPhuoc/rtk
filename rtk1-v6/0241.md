heisig: "The <i>house</i> of <i>flowers</i> or &quot;hothouse&quot; has become a metaphor for a narrow-minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. <b>Tolerance</b>, in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage <b>tolerance</b> in those who lack it is first to have them <i>see</i> through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji."

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 21-7-2008(23): Into my <em>house</em> someone brought a monstrous <em>flower</em> with a big, <em>walking eye</em>, <em>see</em>ing everything, like a spy. But I am trying to be<strong> tolerant</strong>, although it is getting on my nerves. Remember: The <em>flower</em> is IN the <em>house</em> (that is, underneath its roof-sign).
