heisig: "The sense of the key word here is the &quot;all-inclusive&quot; we find in terms like &quot;<b>Pan-</b>American Games.&quot; (It is also the character used in mathematics for &quot;partial&quot; as in partial differentials, in case you are a math major and want to take your story in that direction.) Instead of a <i>water</i> sports event that brings together the best talent, think of a meet of the region's most <i>mediocre</i> athletes, many of whom cannot even tread <i>water</i>. Now try to find a sponsor for the &quot;<b>Pan-</b><i>Mediocre</i> <i>Water</i> Sports Competition.&quot;"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-1-2009(54): This is<strong> pan</strong>- as in the prefix meaning &quot;all&quot;. I think of<strong> Pan</strong>gea as being a mediocre continent with water covering the rest of the planet. This was before it broke up into the first-class, well-distributed continents we got now.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 17-6-2007(22): Yeah, all our <em>water</em> is fairly <em>mediocre</em>, but if we work together in some<strong> pan</strong>-continental union, we can make some better <em>water</em>! As if.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 9-6-2009(20): After<strong> Pan</strong>-Am crashed yet another plane into the <em>water</em>, their reputation dropped to <em>mediocre</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 14-7-2010(6): A person sneezes. The <em>water drops in the wind</em> are about to start a<strong> pan</strong>demic and put the whole world in<strong> pan</strong>demonium.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 30-7-2010(5): <strong>Pan-</strong>Am was such a lousy airline, even the <em>water</em> in their in-flight meals was <em>mediocre</em>.
