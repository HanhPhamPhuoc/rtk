2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 28-2-2006(57): Do you know why every <em>person</em> in Japan has a Louis Vuitton<strong> bag</strong>? After the 1985 JAL air crash that killed 520 people (the world&#039;s worst).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 26-6-2012(13): This is kinda weird, but for some reason it seems to stick: Imagine that whenever you have sex with someone, you put a<strong> bag</strong> over his/her head with <em>Mr. T</em>&#039;s face on the <em>surface</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iheckman">iheckman</a>] 21-5-2008(11): A person&#039;s surface is like a big<strong> bag</strong> keeping their insides inside.
