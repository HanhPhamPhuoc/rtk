heisig: "Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for <i>woman</i> in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a <b>mama</b>. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups."
commen: "* As a primitive we shall add the meaning of <i>breasts</i> in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame."
