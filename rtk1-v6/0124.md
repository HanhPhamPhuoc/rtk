heisig: "Long before the invention of the carpenter's <b>plane</b>, people used knives and machetes (or here, <i>sabers</i>) to smooth out their woodwork. If you have ever seen the process, you will have been amazed at the speed and agility with which the adept can <b>plane</b> a hunk of wood into shape. Indeed, you can almost see the <i>sparks</i> fly from their <i>sabers</i>."
