heisig: "That red-orange color we call <b>vermilion</b> is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the <i>drop</i> hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has <i>not yet</i> fallen as it one day must. Look at its color - vermilion. (Well, not really. The truth is, <b>vermilion</b> is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I'm sure you will agree that autumn leaves area lot easier to work with.)"
