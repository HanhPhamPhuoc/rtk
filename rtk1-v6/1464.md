1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 19-9-2007(160): (dingomick) <em>Venom</em> is upset because Spidey is just that much brainier than he is! He chooses to<strong> accumulate</strong> as many <em>brains</em> as he can, snatching them out of people&#039;s heads and storing them on top of his own, till there&#039;s just one massive <em>brain</em> on top of his head!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mighty_Matt">Mighty_Matt</a>] 22-2-2008(140): When you<strong> accumulate</strong> knowledge in your <em>brain</em>, neural pathways are constructed. All those pathways end up like a huge ball of <em>thread</em> tangled together. The more knowledge you<strong> accumulate</strong> the more <em>threads</em> you throw into the mix!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 23-8-2007(63): Like a jellyfish, a floating BRAIN<strong> accumulate</strong>s THREADS beneath it-- a weird collection.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 14-11-2007(55): <em>Venom</em> is accumulating <em>brains</em> (much like Sylar in Heroes).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 6-1-2008(21): I found billyclyde&#039;s a bit abstract so I picture a <em>brain</em> rolling about the floor, accumulating <em>threads</em> scattered around and getting bigger as it rolls. (this is easy if you&#039;ve played Katamari).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjiknight">kanjiknight</a>] 10-3-2009(19): <em>Spiderpig</em>&#039;s <em>brain</em><strong> accumulate</strong>s a lot of silly things while living with the Simpson&#039;s.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brendanmacdonald">brendanmacdonald</a>] 30-6-2008(17): Spiderman<strong> accumulate</strong>d the power to lift a whole rice field.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Garland">Garland</a>] 14-8-2012(12): This kanji was surely invented right after the release of Matrix: It enpictures milions and milions of <em>human brains</em>, all connected by another milions of <em>threads</em> (or tubes, if you want). Now, we know that the Machines used human for gaining electric energy, so all that is left to imagine is a one giant <strong>accumulator</strong>, <em>down</em> to which all the <em>threads</em> lead.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 17-5-2009(5): The symbiote is <strong>accumulating</strong> near Eddie Brock&#039;s body. When enough of it has <strong>accumulated</strong>, it jumps onto him and attacks the base of his <em>brain</em>, turning him into <em>Venom</em>. (Since <em>Venom</em> only refers to the thread primitive at the bottom of the kanji, this distinguishes it from the <em>Spider-Man</em> primitive in <a href="../v4/1363">dainty</a> (#1363 細).).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 19-12-2008(5): A discussion <em>thread</em> is an accumulation of many <em>brain</em>s.
