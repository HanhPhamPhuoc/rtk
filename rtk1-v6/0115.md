heisig: "In the next lesson we will meet the character for morning-<i>tide</i> and the element for <i>drops of water</i>. Meantime we have a perfect blend of picture and idea in this kanji to play on the English word for nightfall, <b>eventide</b>: <i>drops of water</i> inching their way up the shore in the <i>evening</i>."
