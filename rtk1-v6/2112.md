1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 16-2-2008(235): White<strong> mount</strong> , Fuji<strong> mount</strong> , olympus<strong> mount</strong> whatever ....The choice is yours but wherever you go they sell those snowglobe souvenir : under a GLASS HOOD you can see the<strong> mount</strong> with a MOUTAIN GOAT standing on top of it .... So kitsch you just can&#039;t forget it .

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 22-3-2007(50): Note: Stroke order is belt..horns..mountain, not the same as <em>mountain goat</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(39): This has the same meaning as 丘 , so my &quot;Mount&quot; is a hill with<strong> mount</strong>ain goats on it under a glass canopy. It&#039;s obviously an effort by the locals to add some<strong> Mount</strong> atmosphere to their hill. As a primitive, it has the meaning &quot;sturdy&quot; (really), which Heisig has not used for some reason, but I will. The glass canopy must be pretty sturdy to keep the goats inside (bulletproof glass, I&#039;m sure).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-3-2008(17): Goat + belt = <em>S&amp;M goat</em>. Don&#039;t think too much on the image or you&#039;ll regret it forever. The goat loves the <strong>mount</strong> and it also loves to <strong>mount</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-5-2006(13): My<strong> Mount</strong> is the<strong> Mount</strong> in Dun Morogh where the dwarven capital of Ironforge nestles inside. At the gates to Ironforge you see a bronze<strong> mount</strong>ain goat guarding the entrance, in glass canopy for visitors to watch. This particular goat is the first goat of king Magni Bronzebeard.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 1-1-2009(11): Fukuoka 福岡 is missing a great opportunity by not calling itself<strong> Mount</strong> Blessing on its English-language tourist brochures. They could sell lots of<strong> mount</strong>ain goat snow globes.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 21-6-2008(8): There&#039;s no way that <em>mountain goat</em> will let you<strong> mount</strong> him, so you first have to put a <em>hood</em> over his head, so he can&#039;t see you coming.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Savara">Savara</a>] 7-6-2008(5): On<strong> mount</strong> Everest even <em>mountain goats</em> would need a <em>glass canopy</em> to keep them safe (from the cold).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 12-5-2008(5): <strong>Mount</strong> Glassgoat.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/endote">endote</a>] 13-2-2011(4): The only way I&#039;ll ever get to the top of<strong> Mount</strong> Fukuoka is by putting a belt over the horns of a goat and getting it to pull me up the<strong> mount</strong>ain!!
