heisig: "The idea of <b>memorizing</b> things is easily related to the <i>schoolhouse</i>; and since we have been at it for more than a hundred pages in this book, the idea that <b>memorizing</b> involves <i>seeing</i> things that are not really there should make it easy to put the two elements together."
