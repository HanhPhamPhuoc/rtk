heisig: "The personalism connoted by the word <b>instruction</b>, as opposed to &quot;teaching&quot; or &quot;discipline,&quot; suits the picture here of <i>words</i> guiding one's progress like the gentle flowing of a <i>stream</i>. Even the etymology of the word <b>instruction</b> suggests the sense of &quot;pouring into&quot;."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 2-3-2008(155): The best type of Japanese<strong> INSTRUCTION</strong> is full immersion, which consists of going to Japan and swimming in the <em>stream</em> of <em>words</em> that surrounds you every day.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 10-11-2008(87): Listen carefully to the <em>words</em> of<strong> instruction</strong> before you try swimming in the <em>river</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/markjohnquinn">markjohnquinn</a>] 6-11-2007(39): The best teachers and those we remember most are those that are most patient with us, their WORDS as gentle as a STREAM.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 1-1-2007(35): (technical) A <em>stream</em> of <em>words</em> (byte pairs) carries assembly <strong>instructions</strong> that are executed upon reception.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 6-9-2006(23): This is the first half of the kanji combination with <a href="../v4/129">obey</a> (#129 順). Watch at the person&#039;s <em>words</em>, their <strong>instructions</strong>, turn into a <em>stream</em> which then can be put into the subjects head for them to <a href="../v4/129">obey</a> (#129 順).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-1-2006(16): Think of the<strong> instruction</strong>s that come with the &quot;do it yourself&quot; furniture at Ikea. The<strong> instruction</strong>s are laid out step-by-step, like a <em>stream of words</em>. Either you go with the flow (you follow the<strong> instruction</strong>s in the given order), or you don&#039;t bother with them at all; because it would make no sense to jump paragraphs, or only follow part of the<strong> instruction</strong>s.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 26-11-2009(13): Your <em>keitai</em> has fallen in the <em>stream</em>, so you are reading the<strong> instruction</strong> manual about what to do. (Note: I call 言 &quot;keitai&quot; (portable phone) because of the shape and also you use your keitai for <em>say</em>ing <em>words</em>).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vichango">vichango</a>] 27-5-2009(13): <strong>Instructions</strong> are <em>words</em> that guide you, just like the <em>stream</em> would guide your boat.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 3-12-2008(10): In C++, you can <strong>instruct</strong> the program to output a bunch of <em>words</em> by entering them into a <em>stream</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 13-11-2008(8): <strong>Instructions</strong> are Written <em>Words</em> which are followed like a <em>stream</em>. // But <a href="../v4/129">obey</a> (#129 順) is when the <em>head</em> follows the <em>stream</em> of orders. // <strong>クン、 キン xun4 훈 (hun)</strong>.
