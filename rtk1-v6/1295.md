1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 7-5-2007(205): According to legend, the great Ogaki<strong> wisteria</strong> tree grew and <em>flowered</em> from magical <em>rice grains</em> that were planted under the <em>quarter</em> <em>moon</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 23-12-2005(88): The<strong> wisteria</strong> is a type of hanging vine covered with <em>flowers</em>. By the light of the <em>quarter</em> <em>moon</em>, the <em>flowers</em> look like clusters of <em>rice grains</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 29-3-2007(56): This is easy if you&#039;ve seen Desperate Housewives. Here on<strong> Wisteria</strong> Lane, under the immaculate <em>flowers</em>, you wouldn&#039;t believe the things going on at night under the light of the <em>quarter moon</em>, and we&#039;re not talking about fancy recipes for cooking <em>grains of rice</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks">khooks</a>] 13-6-2010(24): <strong>Wisteria</strong> is a plant that is the color of the moon and only blooms one quarter of the year (spring). It&#039;s best planted in a hole full of rice grains.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pgp27">pgp27</a>] 17-7-2009(19): The<strong> wisteria</strong> is a FLOWER you can cook with MEAT and a QUARTER of a pound of RICE to make a delicious dish.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 28-6-2010(11): <strong>Wisteria</strong> is the <em>flower</em> of the <em>month</em>, so it&#039;s 25% (or a <em>quarter</em>) off, and comes with free <em>grains of rice</em> as a bonus!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xingji">xingji</a>] 1-11-2009(11): The genus<strong> WISTERIA</strong> was given in honour to Caspar Wistar, and apparently the e in<strong> WISTERIA</strong> is a misprint - which is, astonishingly, exactly what happened in Japanese too! It was supposed to be the FLOWER of VICTORY but the guy who was preparing the character during his lunch break let a GRAIN OF RICE fly on the kanji and it was kept as it is... that&#039;s a wisterious story!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KeshaFran">KeshaFran</a>] 27-11-2010(8): <strong>Wisteria</strong> can be mysterious <em>flowers</em> that glow in the <em>moon</em> light and bloom for a <em>quarter</em> of the year, with flowers as small as <em>grains of rice</em>. image: <a href="http://bahraini.tv/2007/07/22/wisterias-cascade-of-beauty/">http://bahraini.tv/2007/07/22/wisterias-cascade-of-beauty/</a>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lugelen">lugelen</a>] 1-4-2013(7): It&#039;s<strong> wisteria</strong> hysteria! The <em>flowers</em> are sold out <em>monthly</em>, and the Japanese are willing to have just a <em>quarter</em> of their normal <em>rice grains</em> in order to save up for a highly sought-after<strong> wisteria</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(7): I picture a vicious killer <strong>hanging vine</strong>. It has <strong>flowers</strong> that eat human <strong>flesh</strong>. I saw it eat Condi <strong>Rice</strong>. The only way to get it to stop is to give it a <strong>quarter</strong>. The vine is trying to complete its collection of all 50 state quarters.
