Parts:扌, 皮 (cf: 破れる , etc.) ... Story: Another meaning for <em>pelt</em> is whatever the <em>natural covering of a fruit</em> is, so with your <em>fingers</em>, you can peel a banana, orange etc. to<strong> expose</strong> what is inside (then eat it, of course). The nice thing about this sort of exposure is you can do it in public, which is good because the most common usage for this kanji IRL is in a compound for introducing a song, etc. in public, too.
