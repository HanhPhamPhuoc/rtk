heisig: "Let the idea of <b>drawing near</b> suggest something dangerous or eerie that one approaches with fear and trembling. Here we see a <i>strange house</i> - perhaps the haunted <i>House</i> of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread <i>House</i> that lured Hansel and Gretel to <b>draw near</b>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 14-11-2007(195): The <em>strange house</em> has a sign saying &quot;DRAW NEAR&quot; in its window, instead of a &#039;Beware&#039; sign. It must be a trick!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/namakemono">namakemono</a>] 19-4-2009(14): As you<strong> draw near</strong> the <em>house</em>, you may hear some <em>strange</em> noises from inside. Don&#039;t worry though; it&#039;ll be the St. Bernard playing with his can.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/isharabash">isharabash</a>] 7-8-2009(7): Why in all horror movies, the actors are always drawn near the strange house, where they&#039;ll soon die?

I mean, come on. A floating brick roof is weird enough, but then it starts floating _towards you_? I&#039;m moving out of this hood.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CSBarnes">CSBarnes</a>] 13-11-2008(6): What a <em>strange house</em>, maybe I shouldn&#039;t<strong> draw near</strong> it.
