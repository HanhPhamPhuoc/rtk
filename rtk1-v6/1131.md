3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-10-2005(28): This<strong> grant</strong> is <em>shells</em> (money) that were awarded to you, or that someone &quot;deigned to give&quot; to you (another kanji meaning). Regardless, they are &quot;<em>easy shells</em>&quot; because you won&#039;t have to return them, and you didn&#039;t have to work for them! -- &quot;grant is <em>easy shells</em>&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 10-6-2010(16): A<strong> grant</strong> may seem like easy money, but then the kanji would be out of order. So you must justify the<strong> grant</strong> <em>money</em> first, then it will be <em>easy</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 6-1-2008(4): The giant clam <strong>grants</strong> you its pearl, so it makes <em>easy</em> for you to open its <em>shell</em>. What a lucky person!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dinmamma">dinmamma</a>] 17-8-2009(3): A<strong> grant</strong> = <em>clams</em> which makes life <em>easier</em> [this order.].
