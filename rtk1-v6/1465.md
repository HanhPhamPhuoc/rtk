1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 14-4-2007(148): Spiderman has been captured and given the ultimate torture: they forced a crown of needles on his head and attached it to an electrical<strong> cord</strong>, which they are about to plug into an outlet...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 16-6-2008(137): (modified akrodha&#039;s great story) VENOM has been captured by scientists and is being experimented on: they forced a CROWN of NEEDLES on his head and attached it to multiple electrical<strong> cord</strong>s, which are connected to a big machine.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 14-1-2008(59): An electrical<strong> cord</strong> has two (or three) prongs - <em>needles</em> - sticking out of it, a housing for the prongs that can be thought of as a <em>crown</em>, and the long <em>thread</em>-like wire leading to the appliance.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biene">Biene</a>] 18-6-2008(47): That&#039;s <em>venom</em> for you! Since he can&#039;t make webs like spiderman can, he&#039;s now desperately hanging from a thin<strong> cord</strong> that he bought cheap in Sweden. It cost him only <em>10 Kroner</em> (Crowns). I&#039;m sure the<strong> cord</strong> will rip in a second or two. (Thanks desmidus).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-1-2010(25): Suggestion: new primitive, let <em>Bishop</em> = <em>cross</em> + <em>crown</em>. (the bishop&#039;s headgear is a crown with a cross on top). Also appears in <a href="../v4/2858">erection</a> (#2858 勃) and <a href="../v4/2883">cyst</a> (#2883 嚢) Story: <em>Spiderman</em> is teaching the <em>bishop</em> how to parachute, and as they plunge together he shouts, &quot;<strong>Cord</strong>!<strong> Cord</strong>! Pull the<strong> Cord</strong>!&quot; (and ends up doing it for him).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 27-2-2007(11): Instead of a utility belt, <em>Black Widow</em> wears a utility <em>crown</em>. She keeps <em>needles</em> and bungie <strong>cord</strong> in it so she never has to [<strong>search</strong>] for anything.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 1-6-2009(8): <em>Ten</em> <em>crown</em>ed <em>thread</em>s make the perfect<strong> cord</strong>.
