heisig: "What you are meant to <b>take along</b> in this kanji are not things but people. The image of the <i>car</i> on the <i>road</i> should ground your image for picking up your friends to <i>take</i> them <i>along</i> to wherever you are going."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 16-9-2007(161): When you put your <em>car</em> on the <em>road</em> you should always<strong> take along</strong> a few friends. Don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/303">carry</a> (#303 運).

And the CAR will help you to GO ALONG the ROAD. This Kanji is the &quot;Union&quot; in Soviet Union and the &quot;United&quot; of United Nations (the countries that &quot;go along with each other&quot; at least some of the time).
