3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 31-8-2007(67): <strong>Divide</strong> and conquer - first you cut them up (saber) , then you shut them up (muzzle).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 25-11-2010(7): 死体解剖 , 解剖学 <a href="../v4/478">divide</a> (#478 剖) ボウ ... Parts:咅, 刂 ... Note: This is <em>not</em><strong> divide</strong>, that is 割る , or 分ける . For RTK testing purposes, make your stories about <strong>dissection</strong>, so later on you don&#039;t get confused by this.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Newkie">Newkie</a>] 24-6-2009(7): <strong>Divide</strong> and conquer - first you shut them up (<em>muzzle</em>), then you cut them up(<em>saber</em>)------ Edited version of dihutenosa story, to better remember positioning :).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 4-1-2010(6): Do not confuse with <a href="../v4/90">separate</a> (#90 別). This is a verb, and thus more active, hence the need to <em>muzzle</em> the dividing of the <em>sword</em>. (<a href="../v4/90">separate</a> (#90 別) is also an adjective). Perhaps use the V in<strong> divide</strong> as a reminder: it is an open sword cut, and picured in the Vase-part of the sign.
