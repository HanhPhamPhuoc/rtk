heisig: "&quot;In the <b>beginning</b>...&quot;&nbsp;starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made <i>two</i> of them, man and woman. While we presume she made <i>two</i> of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only&nbsp;<i>two</i> and a pair of <i>human legs</i> come to the kanji that means <b>beginning</b>."
