1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 16-4-2007(98): You ever wondered why this appeared as a primitive in so many RTK1 kanji? Well, you should know that once a vulture<strong> grab</strong>s hold of a <em>tree</em>, he can never let go. Even Heisig couldn&#039;t shake him loose.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 12-5-2008(30): A common meaning for this kanji is &#039;DICE&#039;. --- Ever wonder what <em>vultures</em> do up in the <em>trees</em>? They play DICE. But of course, being vultures, they are always <strong>grabbing</strong> the dice away from each other.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 4-4-2008(2): The <em>vulture</em> was flying way too fast, so he had to<strong> grab</strong> onto the <em>tree</em> to slow down.
