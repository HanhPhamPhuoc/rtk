heisig: "A <i>sword</i> or <i>dagger</i> posed over a <i>mouth</i> is how the character for &quot;beckoning&quot; is written. The related but less tame key word <b>seduce</b> was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the - how shall we put it? - Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is <b>seducing</b> the small round one or vice versa.)"
commen: "* The primitive meaning remains the same: <i>seduce</i>. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image."

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 7-8-2008(17): 召す 【めす】 (v5s,vt) (1) to call; to send for; (2) to put on; to wear; to take (a bath); to ride in; to buy; to eat; to drink; to catch (a cold); (P) This kanji isn&#039;t anything sexual or anything. It means SUMMON/TO SEND/CALL FOR (as well as honorific form of eat/drink). STORY: A king is having a hard time EATING a piece of of meat b/c it can&#039;t fit in his MOUTH, so he CALLS FOR/SUMMONS someone to bring him his SWORD. (this keeps the eat/drink meaning of the kanji true as well).
