heisig: "Earlier we made mention of the story of <b>Briar</b> Rose (or &quot;Sleeping Beauty,&quot; as we called her in frame 165) and drew attention to the <b>briar</b> hedge that grew up all about her castle. But in the <i>second</i> part of the story, these <b>briars</b> blossomed into <i>flowers</i>. Hence her name, <b>Briar</b> Rose. Be careful not to confuse this character with that for <i>thorn</i> (Frame 446)."
