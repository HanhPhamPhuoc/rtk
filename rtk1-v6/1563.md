1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 24-5-2006(186): Who&#039;s job is it to oversee the water level on the dam? It&#039;ts<strong> overflow</strong>ing!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 1-3-2007(112): The <em>overseer</em> isn&#039;t doing his job and he lets the slaves <strong>overflow</strong> the sink!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 14-3-2007(30): When <em>water</em><strong> overflow</strong>s it is usually because someone was not properly <em>overseeing</em> the task. Image: A mother talking on the phone, <em>overseeing</em> the drawing her kid&#039;s bath, boiling something on the stove, and breaking up a fight between two of the kids. Something is bound to<strong> overflow</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 22-3-2009(17): This is the <em>overseer</em> from the previous kanji, who was watching the slave wash the dishes. Unfortunately, the reclining <em>overseer</em> fell asleep and didn&#039;t notice when the <em>water</em> starting<strong> overflow</strong>ing from the sink. ............................................................................... An alternate version of this story would be the famous scene from Fantasia where Mickey falls asleep and stops <em>overseeing</em> the brooms bringing in <em>water</em>, so the room<strong> overflow</strong>s.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 23-6-2009(14): Water will<strong> overflow</strong>... if you do not oversee.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigpun69">bigpun69</a>] 6-4-2012(2): WATER was<strong> OVERFLOW</strong>ING because the SLAVES had been slacking, by RECLINING on the FLOOR, instead of washing the DISHES.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lernsky">lernsky</a>] 18-2-2012(2): <em>Water</em> has to be <em>overseen</em>, otherwise it <strong>flows over</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lisbet">lisbet</a>] 30-11-2011(2): When I was little, mom needed to <em>oversee</em> me filling the bathtub or I&#039;d<strong> overflow</strong> it every time.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 8-1-2010(2): Without someone to <em>oversee</em> a tub filling with <em>water</em>, it will inevitably<strong> overflow</strong>. Sort of like &quot;A watched pot never boils&quot;. We have, &quot;A watched (<em>overseen</em>) bath never<strong> overflow</strong>s&quot; with <em>water</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 15-4-2009(2): (continuation of <a href="../v4/1453">oversee</a> (#1453 監)) -- &quot;I said finish those Dishes!&quot; cries the <em>Overseer</em>. The slaves quickly inform the <em>Overseer</em> of the <em>Water</em><strong> Overflow</strong>ing from the dish washer. &quot;We must take care of this before the <a href="../v4/855">perusal</a> (#855 覧)!&quot;, he commands.
