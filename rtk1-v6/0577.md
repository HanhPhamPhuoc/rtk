heisig: "Flesh . . . sow."
primit: "sow(locha, maciora) Let this primitive represent a fat sow. Easier than pulling it apart into smaller elements is remembering its shape as a highly stylized pictograph. Practice its 7 strokes a few times before going on to examples of its use in the next six FRAMEs. [7]"
