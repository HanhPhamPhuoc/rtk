1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 16-5-2008(229): After I finish each<strong> chapter</strong> of RTK, I eat a piece of <em>fruit</em> to celebrate all the new <em>words</em> I&#039;ve learned. (Thanks Misha!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 26-9-2007(135): <em>Words</em> signify the written words in a book. The <em>fruit</em> represents something whole, complete. A<strong> chapter</strong> in a book often offers a complete idea, setting, or account. It&#039;s good to disambiguate the keyword from <a href="../v4/82">paragraph</a> (#82 項). To reinforce the kanji, imagine eating a fruit at the end of each<strong> chapter</strong> of Tolstoy&#039;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; to reward yourself. (If you ate a fruit at the end of each paragraph, you&#039;d very quickly run out of fruit).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 12-9-2007(49): The <em>words</em> of each<strong> chapter</strong> bear a different <em>fruit</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 12-12-2008(38): The first<strong> chapter</strong> of the Bible are <em>words</em> telling the story of <em>Adam and Eve</em> and how they ate the forbidden <em>fruit</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 5-10-2007(17): Here we think of the<strong> CHAPTER</strong> of the bible, namely<strong> CHAPTER</strong> three where you hear the lord SAY &quot;Who has eaten of the forbidden FRUIT?&quot; Goes well with the Naked frame that talks of the other forbidden FRUIT.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 20-8-2011(15): <em>Words</em> are the <em>fruit</em> of the<strong> chapter</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelooseteeth">thelooseteeth</a>] 6-3-2009(10): The very first <strong>chapter</strong> of the Biblical <em>Word</em> is the story of the forbidden <em>fruit</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 22-10-2007(9): I know the <em>words</em> to the forbidden <em>fruit</em> story, by heart,<strong> chapter</strong> and verse.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 16-11-2008(8): I picture a drawing of a fruit at at the end of the<strong> chapter</strong>. First there are words, then fruit. Hard to describe but seems to work for me.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 3-11-2007(5): Study a whole RTK<strong> chapter</strong> at one time to reap the <em>fruits</em> of learning associated <em>keywords</em> together.
