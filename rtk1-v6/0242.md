heisig: "Take a good look at this kanji: the &quot;strong&quot; element here is really the <i>flower</i>, not the <i>water</i> as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the <i>acupuncturist</i> from frame 48. Taking the key word to connote <b>diluting</b> the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our <i>acupuncturist</i> performing his task with <i>flowers</i> in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe <i>water</i> into the body of the patient."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda">gaijinda</a>] 17-10-2007(173): A <em>Dr.</em> missing his needle can only use<strong> dilute</strong> <em>flower water</em> for medicine.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 15-2-2008(112): [As suggested by stehr and on the forum (<a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079</a>), we create a new keyword &#039;seaweed&#039; for the <em>flower</em> on top and <em>water</em> below and to the left. See also <a href="../v4/299">fall</a> (#299 落), <a href="../v4/1912">clan</a> (#1912 藩),<a href="../v4/2035">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻). This story is for people using that idea.] The <em>homeopath</em> (a doctor without any needle) specialises in <strong>dilute</strong> medicines. This one&#039;s an essence of <em>seaweed</em> -- just dip the seaweed into the beaker, swish it about and remove. Barmy!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 29-12-2007(94): <strong>Note</strong> This character belongs to a set of characters which share the <em>flower/water</em> primitive such as:: <a href="../v4/227">dilute</a> (#227 薄), <a href="../v4/299">fall</a> (#299 落), <a href="../v4/1912">clan</a> (#1912 藩), and <a href="../v4/2035">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻).... ( 落 薄 藩 藻 ) It may be helpful to create a primitive keyword for this occurrence (like <em>seaweed</em> or <em>watering can</em>) which can save a lot of time distinguishing them from characters like <em>Sino</em> 満 and <em>Full</em> 満 , where the <em>water</em> primitive is larger than the <em>flower</em> primitive.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wzafran">wzafran</a>] 17-6-2007(22): A man with thick blood dripping out of his hands visits an <em>acupuncturist</em>. &quot;Please <strong>dilute</strong> my blood!&quot; he says. The <em>acupuncturist</em> gives the man a seat, punctures his skin with many <em>flower</em> stems, and inserts a <em>drop of</em> cold <em>water</em> through the holes at the top of those stems. The man&#039;s blood becomes soft pink in colour . As too much blood had been <strong>diluted</strong>, he dies.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 15-1-2008(19): A homeopathy <em>specialist</em> takes <em>flowers</em> and <em>dilutes</em> them in some <em>water</em>... (picture my hippie aunt with her homeopathist diluting flowers in water.).
