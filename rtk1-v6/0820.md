heisig: "<i>Infant</i> . . . <i>buckle</i> (See frame 444) . . . <i>tree</i>."
primit: "infant This primitive can be seen as an abbreviation of the full primitive for child, the second stroke dividing the head from the body much as it does in { and the other strokes condensing the long form so that it can be used atop its relative primitive. We change the meaning to infant to facilitate keeping the full form and its abbreviation distinct. [4]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 4-9-2007(274): Think of a really loud and annoying baby, you want to<strong> abandon</strong> it but it keeps coming back...so you take of your belt by the buckle, and buckle the baby to a tree!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 11-4-2007(74): As in <a href="../v4/415">sash</a> (#415 帯), I treat the <em>one</em> <em>mountain</em> in the middle to mean Mt. Fuji (Japan&#039;s ichiban mountain). Now we see an <em>infant</em> being<strong> abandon</strong>ed on top of <em>Mt. Fuji</em> well above the <em>tree</em> line to die of exposure.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 8-11-2007(58): A terrible image of an<strong> abandon</strong>ed <em>infant</em>. Here he is in his little car seat <em>buckled</em> to a <em>tree</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 14-12-2008(27): <strong>Note</strong>: This Kanji does not contain 山 (mountain) as part of its radicals, it can rather be broken down to 木 厶 凵 亠 一 . Hence, it would be best to avoid using mountain in your story. <strong>Story</strong>: An inhumane way to<strong> abandon</strong> an <em>infant</em> is to <em>buckle</em> him to a <em>tree</em>...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 7-6-2009(14): The<strong> abandon</strong>ned <em>infant</em> was <em>buckled</em> to a <em>tree</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-1-2006(14): An<strong> abandon</strong>ed infant is buckled on top of a tree. Use the image of a harness and in particular the shoulder straps (such as when you want to buckle up an infant safely into a car) to avoid confusing the buckle with a sash or belt. Note the play on words with “buckle up”. The parents who<strong> abandon</strong>ed the infant on the side of the road buckled him up with the same harness that came from the car.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 15-4-2007(11): The <em>infant</em> is a baby in a <em>top hat</em> - the hat is so large all you can see is the baby&#039;s elbow sticking out from under it.<strong> Abandon</strong> the baby by <em>buckling</em> him to the top of a <em>tree</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 22-10-2008(6): I just found an<strong> abandon</strong> infant. The poor one was tied to a tree with a sash.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 9-3-2010(5): &quot;<strong>Abandon</strong> hope, all ye who enter here&quot; says the sign at the gates of hell in Dante&#039;s Inferno. Nearby wail 31<strong> abandon</strong>ed <em>infants</em> in car seats <em>buckled</em> to a <em>tree</em>. (strokes: The infants hover above the buckle)... (<strong>infant</strong> = <em>top hat</em> + <em>elbow</em>; the compressed, upside down and backwards form of <strong>child</strong>)... 廃棄 [はいき] disposal, scrap <a href="http://google.com/#q=、棄権者">、棄権者</a> [きけんしゃ] non-voter.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Vinnike">Vinnike</a>] 15-11-2012(3): In Sparta, when they &quot;ABANDONED&quot; an INFANT they deemed too weak, they BELTED it to a TREE in the woods so it wouldn&#039;t come crawling home.
