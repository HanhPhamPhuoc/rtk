1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 12-9-2007(62): Call your friend and he answers the phone &quot;Mochi,<strong> mochi</strong>!&quot; whatever he is <em>eating</em> sure is making it hard to understand. I will <em>puzzle</em> over the content of our conversation for some time to come.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(18): <strong>Mochi</strong> is like a <em>puzzle</em> you <em>eat</em> and solve in your mouth lest you choke.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 14-12-2008(15): <strong>Mochi</strong> ice cream is a puzzling food, I still have no idea how they get that ice cream in there, but it sure tastes good.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 15-1-2010(13): <strong>MOCHI</strong> is so difficult to EAT, it&#039;s a PUZZLE to me why people eat it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 21-6-2010(9): As a promotion, a<strong> MOCHI</strong> manufacturer starts making them as pieces of a jigsaw. Now kids want to buy them not to eat them, but to solve the week&#039;s <em>FOOD PUZZLE</em>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 7-2-2010(6): <strong>Mochi</strong> is a popular <em>food</em>stuff in Japan, but is notable because the making of it is more fun than the <em>eating</em>. In this way, it&#039;s similar to a <em>jigsaw puzzle</em> - the fun comes from working together, not from finishing it.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-8-2008(3): You&#039;re putting together a <em>puzzle</em> made out of<strong> mochi</strong>. It&#039;s a homemade gift from a friend, and you&#039;re having a really, really hard time with it. After a while, you give up and ring your friend up to ask him what the solution to the <em>puzzle</em> is. &quot;I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about -<strong> mochi</strong> puzzle wha?&quot;, he says. &quot;yeah - you know, the<strong> mochi</strong> set you gave me with all the holes and tabs...&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; he says. &quot;I was hungry so I <em>ate</em> bits of each piece, hoping you wouldn&#039;t notice...&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/effer">effer</a>] 10-5-2012(2): Eating<strong> mochi</strong> is like a puzzle. How much to chew? When to swallow?<strong> Mochi</strong> is like gum that you must eat!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 7-8-2011(1): Whenever I see <em>food</em> made of glutinous rice, better known as<strong> mochi</strong>, it <em>puzzles</em> me to no end why do people ever eat it. I mean, it looks like jizz, and seriously has no flavour at all.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 5-2-2011(1): I am <em>puzzled </em>every time my <em>food</em> has<strong> mochi</strong> in it. How do they get it to that consistency.
