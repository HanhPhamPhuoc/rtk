heisig: "The <i>mouth</i> on the left is obvious. The rest is harder. Try this: <i>four St. Bernard dogs bound up</i> in a bunch. Together they should supply a clear enough portrait of a <b>yell</b>, provided you are careful to see all <i>four</i> of them. Note how the final stroke of the <i>four</i> is supplied by the long horizontal stroke of the <i>St .Bernard</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 10-11-2005(223): Think yelp when you hear<strong> yell</strong> to help dinstinguish this from shout (1508). I think of the sounds that would come from the mouths of the 4 dogs if they were bound up together. I&#039;m imagining lots of yelping.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-9-2007(50): <strong>Yell</strong>? You mean, Old <strong>Yell</strong>er. Here, we see four <em>St Bernard dogs</em> all <strong>yell</strong>ing for a chance to play a part in Old <strong>Yell</strong>er. They&#039;re so loud that you have to <em>bound</em> them, and their <em>mouths</em>, up.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 14-12-2007(43): The musher<strong> yell</strong>s at the 4 dogs bound up to the dog sled to get them to run faster and cross the finish line first. (4 St Bernards bound up together makes a dog sled).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 26-1-2009(31): <strong>Note:</strong> 奐 means &quot;clear; bright.&quot; The keyword <a href="../v4/20">bright</a> (#20 明) is already used. However, among all the 3000 Kanjis presented by Heisig, the keyword <em>clear</em> alone is not used, so you might want to use it to refer to this radical. <strong>Story:</strong> Although I could not hear them, seeing their <em>mouth</em>es, it was <em>clear</em> to me that they are<strong> yell</strong>ing.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nac_est">nac_est</a>] 21-7-2007(18): You have to<strong> yell</strong> really hard if you want the <em>four St. Bernard dogs</em> to pull the sled: they don&#039;t like being <em>bound up</em>.
