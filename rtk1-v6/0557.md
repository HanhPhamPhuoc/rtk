1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 6-9-2007(241): Bugs have to go to school to learn how to become <strong>lightning bugs</strong>. Only the brightest bugs graduate to become <strong>lightning bugs</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-2-2007(106): Q: Who&#039;s the smartest <em>insect</em> in <em>school</em>? A: The<strong> lightning-bug</strong>. Because he&#039;s so bright! (Image: lightning bug in school with glasses, pocket protector, etc. Maybe even have some cool kids teasing him).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 30-9-2008(29): In the <em>schoolhouse</em> for <em>insects</em>, the brightest are obviously the<strong> lightning-bug</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 12-8-2008(16): Think of a small Japanese <em>Schoolhouse</em> in the country. The young children have caught some<strong> lightning-bug</strong>s in a jar and placed it next to window. Long after the children go home and the sun sets, the jar continues to illuminate the room. For me, this Kanji isn&#039;t about keywords, but a strong visual.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Davve">Davve</a>] 14-6-2006(14): Poor <em>schoolhouse</em>s can&#039;t afford electricity. As you can&#039;t teach in the dark the only solution is <strong>lightning-bug</strong>s! It&#039;s easy. Catch a thousand or so of them, bunch them together in a box and attach your wires to the box. Electricity flows through the wires as soon as the lightning starts flashing inside the box. Each bug has begun attacking it&#039;s neighbour with it&#039;s special weapon - the stinging rod of Lightning!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Axlen">Axlen</a>] 10-7-2011(6): Where do<strong> Lightning-bug</strong>s go to get enlightened? Why the &#039;<em>schoolhouse</em>&#039; for &#039;<em>insects</em>&#039; of course.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zodiac">zodiac</a>] 3-11-2008(5): This schoolhouse is so poor they don&#039;t have proper lighting. They have to allow<strong> lightning-bug</strong>s (fireflies) into their building.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lhong1987">lhong1987</a>] 5-2-2013(3): An old Asian story goes that a poor scholar couldn&#039;t afford candles to study at night. He caught bunch of<strong> lightning-bug</strong> and kept them in a container made of thin paper to provide reading light. Thus, study/school is on top and bug on the bottom.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delenir">delenir</a>] 10-6-2009(3): Before SCHOOLHOUSES had electricity, they got their light from a helpful<strong> LIGHTNING-BUG</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/missblit">missblit</a>] 5-1-2013(2): A schoolhouse for smart insects. Of course all the brightest insects are lightning bugs. When one of them knows an answer to a particularly hard question they&#039;ll light up bright as day.
