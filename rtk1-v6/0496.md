heisig: "The Roman numeral I - like that for II we met earlier in frame 379 - is only rarely used now. In the midst of all the <i>samurai</i>, we notice one in particular <i>sitting on the ground</i> with a <i>crown</i> on his head, indicating that he is &quot;number I&quot; in the current rankings."

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/deouro">deouro</a>] 21-2-2012(6): Unlike roman numerals there&#039;s nothing archaic about the usage of this kanji. This is how you&#039;d write &#039;one&#039; on a cheque so the person you paying it to can&#039;t change it into a &#039;two&#039; or a &#039;three&#039;. So with that in mind, the hard up samurai ( 士 ) has been selling ( 売 ) his crown ( 冠 ) is now sitting down ( 匕 ), you give him a cheque for 1 yen, but are sure to customize it for him. You write it 壱 yen, so he can&#039;t change it to a 3 ( 三 ) before he cashes it in!
