1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 4-6-2008(224): <em>Spidey&#039;</em>s<strong> exploits</strong> are world famous but still The Daily Bugle&#039;s pages <em>blame</em> him for every problem out there.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 12-11-2005(99): [Geek alert] A lot of modern software is full of<strong> exploits</strong> which can be abused by hackers. I blame multi-threading.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 17-5-2007(30): Thorough psychological analysis reveals that all of Spiderman&#039;s villains are actually obsessed with him and long to be &quot;dominated&quot; by him. Therefore, the citizens of New York have no-one to <em>blame</em> but <em>Spiderman</em> for these villains&#039; reckless<strong> exploits</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 30-6-2009(29): <em>Spiderman&#039;s</em><strong> exploits</strong> have earned him fame and <em>blame</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 12-12-2009(24): The<strong> exploits</strong> of the RTK online community are such that every single poster has personified the thread radical into Spiderman. I blame it on the video games and TV that the kids are watching now-a-days.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 10-1-2008(14): Those <em>Spiderman</em> comics are way overpriced. I <em>blame</em> Marvel for <strong>exploiting</strong> the pockets of youngsters.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slats70">slats70</a>] 5-1-2009(12): <em>Spiderman</em> gets the <em>blame</em> for the<strong> exploits</strong> of the villain he is trying to catch.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 6-2-2008(11): 功績 【こうせき】 (n) achievements; merit; meritorious service; meritorious deed; (P) 業績 【ぎょうせき】 (n) achievement; performance; results; work; contribution; (P) This kanji means more towards &quot;achievement&quot; as you can see. STORY: SPIDERMAN ACHIEVES all because he does not BLAME anyone else on his problems. He solves crime all by himself.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SimHuman">SimHuman</a>] 20-12-2009(7): Spider-man began his<strong> exploits</strong> because he blamed himself for his Uncle Ben&#039;s death.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 1-3-2007(5): The sense of the keyword<strong> exploits</strong> is that of accomplishments or achievements, not exploitation in the sense of abuse. As in, &quot;the<strong> exploits</strong> of so-and-so.&quot; My greatest exploit was to bring to justice those <em>bad oysters</em> blamed for stunting the growth of the townspeople and see them <em>strung</em> up.
