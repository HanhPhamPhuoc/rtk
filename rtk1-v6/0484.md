heisig: "Think of the housewives in TV commercials &quot;<i>comparing</i> the <i>whiteness</i>&quot; of their laundry across the fence, a typical advertisement for the popular detergent known as <b>All</b>. (If you don't know the brand, surely you've heard the phrases &quot;<b>all</b>-purpose detergent&quot; or &quot;<b>all</b>-temperature detergent.&quot;)"

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 29-1-2008(141): Sometimes, Dr. Heisig&#039;s keyword choices are really quite bizarre. This doesn&#039;t mean<strong> all</strong>, it means <strong>everyone</strong>!! Picture two ku klux klansmen <em>comparing</em> whose <em>skin</em> is whiter...finally, they agree that <strong>everyone</strong> there is white.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 10-2-2008(42): <strong>皆</strong>さん、<strong>みんな</strong>さん, lets <strong>all</strong> <em>compare</em> our <em>whites</em>! This could be a line from a Japanese soap commercial or analysis the Republican presidential candidates.....

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deonnn">Deonnn</a>] 26-11-2007(34): If we <em>compare</em> ourselves to the perfect purity (the <em>whiteness</em>) that God demands of us, we see that &quot;<strong>all</strong> have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&quot; (Romans 3:23).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 31-5-2009(21): <strong>All</strong> detergents claim that, when <em>comparing</em> to other brands, they produce the <em>whitest</em> laundry. But you can save lots of cash when you realize that they&#039;re <strong>all</strong> ok.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 3-9-2007(12): Imagine having<strong> all</strong> the cocaine in the world concentrated into two spoons you&#039;re holding in your hands. First you have to cut the stuff with some<strong> All</strong> laundry detergent.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 1-2-2010(10): As this means everyone, or<strong> All</strong> people, &quot;All Japanese People&quot; <em>compare</em> their skin for <em>white</em>ness.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama">Ameyama</a>] 4-4-2008(7): If you <strong>compare</strong> the contents of these two <strong>spoons</strong> of <strong>white</strong> cocaine, you will realise that neither is<strong> ALL</strong> pure...
