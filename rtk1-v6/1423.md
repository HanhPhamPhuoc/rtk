1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 21-5-2007(374): Be sure to put a <em>hole</em> in that ceramic <em>sheep</em> before you put it over the <em>fire</em>. Otherwise, it&#039;ll just explode in the<strong> kiln</strong>. (If you&#039;ve never done ceramics before, it&#039;s important that the object have a hole in it, or this really will happen.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 14-4-2008(34): You put the sheep in the hole of the<strong> kiln</strong> and turn on the flames.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 3-1-2008(13): Oh Boy! A craft project indeed! Thru the <em>hole</em> in the top of the <strong>kiln</strong>, put in the <em>sheep</em> you sculpted from clay. Turn on the <em>fire</em> underneath and voila!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 25-1-2008(11): I kept forgetting the <em>sheep</em> in smithsonian&#039;s story, so just imagine the sound effects: &quot;Baaa...&quot; (bleating)/Baaam! (explosion).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 3-6-2009(8): <em>Paris Hilton</em> doing a <em>sheep</em> in a<strong> kiln</strong>. Turn on the <em>fire</em> and roast the horrific image out of your memory.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/henroski">henroski</a>] 3-3-2008(6): ...to hell with the BBQ it&#039;s too small, just chuck the &quot;WHOLE&quot; SHEEP in the<strong> KILN</strong> mate, keep the FLAMES down low and it will be done nicely in no time...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 22-9-2009(5): In Japan, &quot;ジンギスカン&quot; is Mongolian-style lamb yakiniku. This is Genghis <strong>Kiln</strong>, Mongolian <em>sheep</em> cooked over a <em>fire</em> in a<strong> kiln</strong> with a <em>hole</em> in the top.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame">yukkuri_kame</a>] 24-6-2009(4): Tandoori Mutton is a dish made of sheep baked in<strong> kiln</strong> which is little more than a hole with some fire in it. <a href="http://www.moghulcuisine.com/images/tandoori2.jpg">http://www.moghulcuisine.com/images/tandoori2.jpg</a>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-4-2007(4): I thought that <em>hole</em> on the top of the<strong> kiln</strong> was the door. So I put my clay <em>sheep</em> inside to be <em>fire</em>d. Turns out it was a <em>black hole</em>!
