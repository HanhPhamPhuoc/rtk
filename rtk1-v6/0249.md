heisig: "To avoid confusion with the image of rice seedlings to appear later, we shall take these <b>seedlings</b> out of their agricultural setting in the <i>rice fields</i> and into the frame of Brave New World surgery, where &quot;ideas&quot; or &quot;values&quot; are being implanted into <i>brains</i> like <b>seedlings</b> to insure a harmonious society. Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into <i>flower</i> right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 31-7-2007(184): If you plant<strong> seedling</strong>s in a FIELD eventually they will FLOWER.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 5-6-2008(61): Crap! There are <em>flowers</em> in the <em>rice field</em>... Who let those <strong>seedlings</strong> get in there?!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tanaquil">tanaquil</a>] 15-4-2007(43): This is obviously a flower sprouting from a rice field, and means &quot;<strong>rice<strong> seedling</strong></strong>&quot; in Japanese. My problem is keeping this kanji distinct from 圥, which Heisig dubs the &quot;<strong>rice<strong> seedling</strong></strong>&quot; primitive (see <a href="../v4/1513">land</a> (#1513 陸) ff.). It might help to keep in mind that 圥 is a rare kanji (not used in Japanese) meaning &quot;mushroom,&quot; so I will call 圥 the &quot;<strong>mushroom<strong> seedling</strong></strong>&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cmayernik">cmayernik</a>] 25-5-2009(24): All the <em>flowers</em> in the <em>field</em> started as <strong>seedlings</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chocobonstrife">Chocobonstrife</a>] 26-4-2012(16): Pikmin have FLOWERS growing out of their<strong> seedling</strong> BRAINS.
