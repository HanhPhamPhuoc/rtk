3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 20-12-2007(31): The most <em>powerful<strong> task</strong>master</em> knows how to multi-<strong>task</strong>. Here he&#039;s given himself the impossible<strong> task</strong> of <em>halberd</em> sparring with one arm, and <em>muscle</em> building with the other - and he&#039;s succeeding!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 28-6-2009(21): A first RPG<strong> task</strong>--not even a full quest, just a<strong> task</strong> some random dude gives you (you always have to start off with some stupid weapon and go kill some other random dude, for no reason). Here, take this <em>halberd</em> I happen to have lying around. Now go kill the <em>taskmaster</em> and his hired-<em>muscle</em> UNDERling.

(and it&#039;s about friggin&#039; time, since he&#039;s been hanging around for the last 900 Kanji doing everything but his stupid<strong> task</strong>).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 20-9-2008(7): <em>Mao Zedong</em> had the <em>power</em> to make even a <em>taskmaster</em> do<strong> task</strong>s.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 5-3-2008(5): Your<strong> task</strong>, if you choose to accept it, is to take this halberd, sneak into Hitler&#039;s bunker, and impale him with all the power you can muster!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 4-10-2006(5): The<strong> task</strong> that all <em>Swiss guards</em> want is to be bodyguard to the <em>taskmaster</em> (the Pope) and use their <em>muscle power</em> to keep him safe.
