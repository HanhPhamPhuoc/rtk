1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 30-9-2010(35): This kanji shows a policeman with a <strong>holed gem</strong> (which can be thought of as <em>jewelry</em>, I guess), but he thinks it&#039;s a doughnut. For some reason though, he liked his doughnuts with ketchup on them, so he added some, and tried to take a bite. He lost a few teeth on the process.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 9-12-2009(20): <strong>perfection</strong>: Only the tomatoes of perfection, comparable to jewels, were used for the expensive ketchup.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-11-2011(19): 完璧 <a href="../v4/3021">holed gem</a> (#3021 璧) <strong>Holed Gem</strong> RTK ＃1500.1 ヘキ ... Parts: 壁 - 土 , 玉 ... Note: This is a new official Kanji added 05/10 to the Japanese lists. Japanese people mix this and 壁 up all the time, so learn them together. <strong>Holed Gem</strong> is the official Heisig Keyword. (though it has nothing to do with IRL usage. IRL this is just the second half of 完璧 . It&#039;s only used in that compound, but that compound is very very common, and means <strong>Perfect!</strong> as an exclamation. ...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drwaltoa">drwaltoa</a>] 15-9-2011(15): It&#039;s a little known fact that <em>ketchup</em> is highly corrosive and is used to cut <strong>holes</strong> into <strong>gemstones</strong> so they can be put onto chains. This kanji shows a piece of <em>Jade</em> with a blob of <em>ketchup</em> on the top eating a hole through it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 15-8-2010(8): <strong>Holed Gem</strong>, <em>ketchup</em>, <em>jewel</em>. According to Rikichan, this is bi (ancient Chinese artifact, flat jade or glass disc with a circular hole in the centre). It used to be a perfect un<strong>holed gem</strong> until Indiana Jones showed up and replaced the <em>jewel</em> in the center with <em>ketchup</em>. All they were left with was a piece of worthless glass with a hole in middle. But it did taste good.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 24-12-2010(5): Damnit, I spilled <em>ketchup</em> on my <strong>holed gem</strong> and clogged the <em>jewel</em>. 完 <strong>璧</strong> (かんぺき) - perfect.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pjuice">pjuice</a>] 6-12-2009(3): <strong>splendid</strong>: ah, splendid! those tomatoes are such nice <em>balls</em>, real <em>jewels</em> you could say! they&#039;re just <strong>splendid</strong> for making <em>ketchup</em> ( 完璧 = かんぺき).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 2-6-2011(2): Even more valuable and perfect ( 完璧 ) than a <strong>holed gem</strong> is a delicious meat<em>ball</em> (ball = たま = 玉 ) with <em>ketchup</em>. Yum!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 17-1-2011(2): Wtf is<strong> holed gem</strong>? check out the wikipedia page for the character (translated from JP): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_%28jade%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_%28jade%29</a>. I had to grease up the<strong> holed gem</strong> with <em>ketchup</em> so that my <em>ball</em> could fit through. Drop by <em>drop</em>, the <em>ketchup</em> leaked off. Dang.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormraven">Stormraven</a>] 27-4-2012(1): A street hot dog vendor is using a <em><strong>bi</strong></em>, an ancient<strong> holed gem</strong>, as a work surface on his cart. He has no idea that this artifact covered in <em>ketchup</em> stains is actually a rare <em>jewel</em> of archaeology.
