7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 10-9-2009(7): <strong>Philosophy</strong> need not be deep to be profound: fortune cookies: the <em>fold</em>ed paper inside that you read before putting the rest in your <em>mouth</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(6): I <em>fold</em> my <em>mouth</em>, therefore I <strong>philosophy</strong>. Doesn&#039;t make sense? That&#039;s <strong>philosophy</strong> for you.
