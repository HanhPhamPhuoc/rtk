heisig: "Since you probably don't know what a <b>paulownia</b> <i>tree</i> is, we shall let the key word suggest the phrase &quot;the Little Brothers of St. <b>Paulownia.</b>&quot; It is a short step to associate the <i>tree</i> with the <i>monks</i> to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental <i>tree</i> really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.)"
