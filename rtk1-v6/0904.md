1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 17-7-2006(331): In the male-dominated world of yesterday, the husband&#039;s way of seeing things was considered the<strong> standard</strong> point of view. Women who dared to disagree were frowned upon.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 26-10-2007(58): Unfortunately, Homer Simpson is the<strong> standard</strong> model of a husband in American society. (Placement: You have to <em>look</em> in the RIGHT places to find one that doesn&#039;t fit that mold.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rodders">rodders</a>] 15-10-2009(41): <em>Husbands</em> that still <em>look</em> (at beautiful women, at porn) are the<strong> standard</strong>. Those that don&#039;t are either saints and martyrs, asexual or blind.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 1-12-2007(29): Ugh. You can tell what her<strong> standard</strong>s are just by <em>seeing</em> her <em>husband</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 7-4-2009(16): The<strong> standard</strong> <em>husband</em> does a lot of <em>watching</em>, when the wife is NOT <em>watching</em> that is!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 14-10-2009(11): <em>Homer looks</em> at his<strong> standard</strong> keyboard. Where&#039;s the &quot;ANY KEY&quot;?

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 16-12-2008(8): Your <em>husband</em> is the<strong> standard</strong> model, I <em>see</em>. You should upgrade to the new Stepford Husband 2.0!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 6-11-2008(6): <em>Homer Simpson</em> gives a thorough <em>look</em> over of Millhouse, Lisa&#039;s first boyfriend. Then he starts complaining about how wimpy he is. Millhouse doesn&#039;t meet Homer&#039;s<strong> standard</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/japanralf">japanralf</a>] 28-3-2008(6): The husband tells her in the wedding night &quot;look at my big one&quot;. She &quot;sees&quot; it and says &quot;its not big - just <strong>standard</strong>&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibilchan">chibilchan</a>] 28-8-2009(5): Regulation, rule,<strong> standard</strong>, norm. I think of this as a husband show, much like a car show, attended by women who are looking for mates. A<strong> standard</strong> model husband is standing with outstretched arms and love handles on a rotating platform as the salesman invites all of the ladies to take a look. The next husband to be displayed has a few more features.
