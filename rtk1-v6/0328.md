heisig: "A <i>whirlwind</i> begins to dig its way into the <i>soil</i> like a drill until it makes a deep <b>pit</b>."

If you have had any trouble with that character, you now have the requisite elements to make a story: Six suggests the number of spider’s legs; just set a tall silk top hat on the crawling creature and you have your character.
