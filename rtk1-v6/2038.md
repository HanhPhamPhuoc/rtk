heisig: "Between the <i>top hat</i> and the <i>scarf</i> you will see the character for <i>in</i> which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the <i>scarf</i>. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the <i>in</i> (the <i>walking stick</i> in the <i>mouth</i>) was set on its side; here it is set upright."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-7-2007(267): The guy from <a href="../v4/401">pathetic</a> (#401 哀) shared his<strong> inmost</strong> feelings with a girl and she rammed a <em>walking stick</em> down his throat. It ruptured his<strong> inmost</strong> organs.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 4-10-2007(59): Besides making money from acting like a dog (see decline), the <em>pathetic</em> man has risked his<strong> inmost</strong> internal organs by becoming a <em>cane</em> swallower!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(45): I&#039;m going with 9 strokes: the magician pulled <em>10 scarves</em> from the <strong>inmost</strong> part of his <em>mouth</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 18-4-2008(35): <strong>Note</strong>: Incorrect stroke order and count in book. Is written <em>one</em>, <em>mouth</em>, <em>walking stick</em>, <em>scarf</em>, with 9 strokes. [It evolved from a combination of <em>garment</em> and <em>in</em> (meaning undergarments), so maybe it used to be written as described in the book...].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 22-10-2008(11): The <em>pathetic</em> emo guy is always talking about his<strong> inmost</strong> feelings. Sometimes I want to shove a <em>walking stick</em> in his <em>mouth</em> to stop him talking.
