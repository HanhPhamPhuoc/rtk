heisig: "Used chiefly in proper names, and given the sound &quot;i,&quot; this kanji can be remembered as an abbreviation of <b>Italy</b>, for which it is still used today in Japan. Its primitives: <i>person</i> . . . <i>mop</i>."
primit: "mop The only thing distinguiinges a mop from a rake is the bent handle that does not cut through the top horizontal stroke. It depicts the swish-swash motion of a mop. [4]"
