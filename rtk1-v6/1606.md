The top-hatted villian of society with a belt around their elbow. Here, the <em>junkie</em> is getting a fix of<strong> crystal</strong> meth: the <em>jewel</em> in the crown of today&#039;s drugs.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 29-6-2008(14): Primitive: <em>Sheik</em> is too vague for me. How about Prince Ali, Aladdin dressed up like a sheik to impress Princess Jasmine? I&#039;ll use Aladdin or Prince Ali for this primitive, whichever works best in a story. Story: Prince Ali holds up a large<strong> crystal</strong> <em>jewel</em> to impress Princess Jasmine. She looks quite bored, but the Sultan looks thrilled!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 19-1-2009(10): When Oddjob ran out of shoes to throw he tossed a<strong> crystal</strong> ball.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 4-1-2009(7): If you spend too much time looking into a<strong> crystal</strong> <em>ball</em>, you may become <em>detached</em> from reality. If you ever see a turkey in the<strong> crystal</strong> ball, detach it immediately.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 5-1-2010(5): The super-villain DETACHO (see <a href="../v4/1492">detach</a> (#1492 離)) looks into his <strong>crystal</strong> <em>ball</em> planning new evil.

STORY: Leaving turkeys aside, this kanji reveals why his hat was so lethal: it&#039;s rim was <em>jewelled</em> with razor sharp quartz<strong> crystal</strong>.
