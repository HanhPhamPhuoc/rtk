1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(229): I have an<strong> inferiority</strong> complex because I have <em>fewer</em> <em>muscles</em> than everyone else at the gym. They all look like <em>Macho Man Randy Savage</em> (power) to me.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtstutz">dtstutz</a>] 4-5-2008(4): To remember the position of the radicals: A bunch of athletes are standing around in the weight room, taking turns lifting weights with barbells over their head. When it&#039;s time for the distance runner to lift, he can&#039;t do it. He removes some plates, and still can&#039;t. Finally he removes all but <strong>a few</strong> plates, and blushes with<strong> inferiority</strong> as his <strong>muscles</strong> can only lift a barbell with <strong>a few</strong> plates.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto">akimoto</a>] 19-9-2006(4): If your powers are under a few, you may feel some<strong> inferiority</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 11-2-2011(3): Having <em>few muscles</em> causes some<strong> inferiority</strong> complexes.
