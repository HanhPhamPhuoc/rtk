heisig: "With a <i>mouth</i> under a <i>cliff</i>, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great <b>stone</b> has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> should be enough to push the <b>stone</b> aside. But take care - the <i>cliff</i> is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. This is the one and only time that the second stroke in <i>cliff</i> will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of."
commen: "* The <i>stone</i> is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of <i>stones</i> or <i>rocks</i> of any size or shape."

Just see it as a<strong> stone</strong> [いし] being <em>hammered</em> by a miner searching for jewel<strong> stone</strong>s [ほう<strong>せき</strong>] ;).
