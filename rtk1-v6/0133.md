heisig: "The elements we are given to work with here are <i>St. Bernard dog</i> and <i>can</i>. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the key word, but they end up too abstract because of the word <i>can</i>. It is important in such cases (and there will be plenty of them as we go along)&nbsp;to stick closely to the&nbsp;elements, in this case, <i>mouth</i>&nbsp;and <i>nails</i>. Now all we need do is create a fictitious &quot;<b>Strange</b> But True&quot; column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a <i>St. Bernard</i> whose <i>mouth</i> has been <i>nailed</i> shut because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beeber">Beeber</a>] 12-6-2007(238): I find it<strong> strange</strong> that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train. To me when I look at this kanji, I see a train just about to come out of a tunnel, and above the man waiting for his oppourtunity where he can end it all.
