1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 28-5-2007(76): The <em>vulture</em> is on top of the <em>porter</em> and appears to be commiting a<strong> lewd</strong> act, so I throw <em>water</em> over the pair of them.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 19-11-2008(21): The PORTER is<strong> lewd</strong> like hell. If a female guest tries to enter the hotel, he throws himself on her like a VULTURE. Therefore it is highly recommended for the ladies to bring some cold WATER and pour it over him to cool him down.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 12-11-2009(18): The <em>porter</em> is <em>dripping wet</em> and has <em>claw marks</em> down his back. He receives a big tip for the unspeakably<strong> lewd</strong> acts he committed with a wealthy heiress guest, after she showed she expected more of him than just carrying her bags up to her suite.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 5-7-2011(7): I always knew the Porter was a letch ever since he showed up in the kanji for <a href="../v4/507">pregnancy</a> (#507 妊). In fact, he&#039;s like a <em>vulture</em> that preys on women. Make sure to splash some cold <em>water</em> on that<strong> lewd</strong> creep. 淫ら ; 猥ら 【みだら】 (adj-na,n) loose; bawdy; improper; dirty 姦淫 【かんいん】 (n,vs) adultery.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 2-8-2011(4): The <em>porter</em>, who is very<strong> lewd</strong> (there&#039;s often something wrong with those guys), likes to watch fetish porn of <em>vultures</em> having sex in <em>water</em>. I think it&#039;s a picture vivid enough for the kanji with<strong> lewd</strong> <em>porter</em> jerking off in his room to a TV screening a couple of <em>vultures</em> doing it in <em>water</em> of some pond or such.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiwiburner">kiwiburner</a>] 1-8-2012(2): The most<strong> lewd</strong> act started in the swimming pool&#039;s <em>water</em>, the <em>vulture</em> hovering above the <em>porter</em>&#039;s gaping mouth.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tashippy">tashippy</a>] 12-1-2012(1): The <em>vulture</em>, a dangerous drunk, was starting to tell his<strong> lewd</strong> jokes, so the bartender began <em>watering</em> down his <em>porter</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 26-11-2011(1): I threw WATER on the<strong> LEWD</strong> EAGLE that was SLASHING the KING.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abraxox">abraxox</a>] 22-8-2011(1): Im Wasser befinden sich sexy Badenixen. Ein lüsterner Perverser hat seinen Geier abgerichtet die Träger der Bikinis zu lösen. Er beobachtet lüstern.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Louismi">Louismi</a>] 18-6-2011(1): This is an act of<strong> lewd</strong> &#039;water sports&#039;, the vulture is peeing on the porter.
