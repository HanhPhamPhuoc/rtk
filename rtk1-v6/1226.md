1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 28-5-2007(191): A monk won a <em>gold metal</em> for breaking the current<strong> record</strong> for most <em>swept rice</em> in one minute.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 6-8-2006(144): This character is about a <strong>record</strong>ing for a music box. The tines of the mechanism are like a <em>metal</em> <em>broom</em> and the little pins on the cylinder are like <em>metal</em> <em>grains of rice</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 4-2-2007(83): Historians have discovered an ancient<strong> record</strong> about Buddhist monastic life<strong> record</strong>ed in <em>gold</em> plates. Sadly, the only thing the monks did was use their <em>brooms</em> to sweep up <em>rice</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 14-6-2008(38): For the combination of broom+rice I&#039;ll use Curling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling</a> where the stone has been replaced with an onigiri rice ball (thanks Katsuo). So here, the Canadian team is recieving a GOLD medal for breaking the world<strong> record</strong> for points scored in CURLING.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 16-9-2009(30): The <strong>right part</strong> should be a new <strong>primitive</strong> since it will appear several times (see <a href="../v4/1371">green</a> (#1371 緑), <a href="../v4/2145">peel off</a> (#2145 剥) and <a href="../v4/2602">salarium</a> (#2602 禄)) and can easily confused with similar stroke combinations. I suggest <strong>videotape</strong>, deduced from its Chinese meaning (thx shinclef).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 8-8-2009(22): Using a <em>golden</em> <em>broom</em>, a man broke the world<strong> record</strong> for <em>rice grains</em> sweeping.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 22-3-2013(20): This may be of interest to some. [录 [lù] verb -<strong> record</strong>; write down; copy; videotape] (<a href="http://goo.gl/3jHhU">http://goo.gl/3jHhU</a>) The web address shows the 录 part of the kanji with meanings and examples. My Story: <em>Metal</em> that you write down on to <em>record</em> (v.) with is a<strong> record</strong> (n.).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(12): My<strong> record</strong> just went <em>gold</em>. The only instruments in it were <em>brooms</em> and maracas (filled, of course, with <em>grains of rice</em>).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(12): Tip: <em>broom</em> + <em>rice grains</em> : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it may be worthwhile giving it a name. <em>record</em> (FRAME 1144) , <a href="../v4/1371">green</a> (#1371 緑), <a href="../v4/2145">peel off</a> (#2145 剥), <a href="../v4/2602">salarium</a> (#2602 禄).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tummai">tummai</a>] 26-5-2008(8): <em>Rice</em> takes about 40 minutes to cook, so to pass the time I like to put on a <em>metal</em><strong> record</strong> and pretend to play the guitar using a <em>broom</em>. Then, after all that, at the very end, I can enjoy my <em>rice</em>.
