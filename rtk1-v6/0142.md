heisig: "Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the <b>meadow</b> you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain <b>meadow</b> in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; will help.) Simply think of little <i>springs</i> bubbling up across the <b>meadow</b> to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous <i>cliff</i>. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the <i>springs</i>, and then falling headlong over the <i>cliff</i>, you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 28-8-2007(148): Follow the <em>springs</em> down the <em>cliff</em> and you will find a nice<strong> meadow</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra">LeoOra</a>] 7-2-2008(73): Sorry about this, but Heisig was stupid calling this kanji<strong> meadow</strong>, used in composite words the most common meaning is <strong>ORIGIN</strong>... To remember just think that life may have begun in <em>pound</em>s or <em>spring</em>s in a land with many <em>cliff</em>s ... Just to answer correctly the review lessons think of<strong> meadow</strong> as the <em>origin</em> of a huge forest.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 16-4-2009(62): Forget about &quot;spring&quot; because the water primitive is abbreviated to &quot;little&quot;. This is easy to forget by the time you&#039;ve finished RTK1. Instead, imagine standing on an exceedingly high <em>cliff</em>. Not overlooking the sea, but overlooking<strong> meadow</strong>s. And what on earth are those <em>white little</em> things? Wow, they&#039;re sheep! This cliff must be really high!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus">findus</a>] 22-10-2007(57): When in a<strong> meadow</strong>, the japanese girls who are <em>white</em> and <em>small</em> search for the shadow of a <em>cliff</em> to avoid taning.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mazel">mazel</a>] 29-8-2007(26): [L2]. Under a CLIFF is a<strong> meadow</strong> with WHITE SMALL flowers.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cinnamon">Cinnamon</a>] 20-6-2009(10): For those of you who can&#039;t decide whether to stick to<strong> meadow</strong> or go for origin, here&#039;s both. Imagine a<strong> meadow</strong> that is shaded by a <em>cliff</em> being the origin of a special type of <em>white</em> flower that can grow in a very <em>small</em> number of places.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-11-2007(9): Julie Andrews sings and skips along the <em>spring</em> in the<strong> MEADOW</strong>, but she&#039;s enjoying herself too much to notice the <em>cliff</em> until it&#039;s too late...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Melchizadek">Melchizadek</a>] 27-12-2009(8): In order to not put the full kanji for <em>spring</em> in where it doesn&#039;t belong, I&#039;m going to call that primitive a <em>lamb</em> because it&#039;s <em>white</em> and <em>little</em>. So, the shepherd <strong>originally</strong> kept his flock of <em>lambs</em> on the top of a <em>cliff</em>, but they kept falling off, so he moved them to a <strong>meadow</strong> instead.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta">Dualta</a>] 10-3-2008(7): Beneath the <strong>cliff</strong>, there is a <strong>spring</strong> which runs into a<strong> meadow</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dzurn">dzurn</a>] 23-8-2011(6): [<strong> Meadow</strong>/origin = <em>Little White</em> flowers under a <em>Cliff</em>, Edelweiss!].
