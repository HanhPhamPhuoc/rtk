1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 17-1-2007(255): The <strong>constitution</strong> is important. At least my parents thought so. In the <em>house</em> where I <em>grew up</em>, it was framed on the wall. Under the watchful (sideways) <em>eye</em> of my mother, we had to study it until we knew it by <em>heart</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 4-3-2007(77): The <em>house</em> of US Congress needs to <em>grow up</em>! Their <em>twisted</em> eyes have lost the <em>heart</em> of the <strong>constitution</strong>.

Since its creation, it&#039;s gotten <em>bigger and bigger</em>, and it&#039;s even grown a <em>pair of eyes</em>, as well as a <em>beating heart</em>. Naturally the Emperor tries to keep this hidden from the public, but what will they do once the<strong> constitution</strong>-monster becomes big enough to destroy the palace?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 5-1-2009(34): I <em>grow up</em> in a <em>house</em> which values the<strong> constitution</strong>. My father always told me to look not just with my <em>eyes</em> but with my <em>heart</em> as well.

We&#039;ll scream till we&#039;re pink!&quot; (Hey, I&#039;m trying here - there are no other Peter Pan stories.).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 14-2-2008(11): In the house you see Alice leaning over Sauron&#039;s eye, who is writing: a<strong> constitution</strong>. She advices him to put a bit more heart in the<strong> constitution</strong> and less control.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 25-7-2009(6): <em>Growing up</em> in the white <em>house</em> all <em>eyes</em> would be on you... you&#039;d have to know the<strong> constitution</strong> by <em>heart</em>!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 8-1-2011(3): In the house of grown ups, squinty eyed conservatives and bleeding heart liberals battle over the<strong> constitution</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 12-5-2009(3): The<strong> constitution</strong> states the following rights: You may live in your own <em>house</em> and <em>grow up</em>. And you will never be watched by big brother&#039;s <em>eye</em> so they cannot control your <em>heart</em> (your believes).
