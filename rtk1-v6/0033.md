heisig: "You couldn't have asked for a better key word for this kanji! Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a <b>concave</b> lens (remembering, of course, that the kanji square off rounded things), complete with its own little &quot;cave.&quot; Now all you have to do is learn how to write it."
