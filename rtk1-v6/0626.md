1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo">rizzo</a>] 21-10-2005(190): We once had a <em>dog</em> with big paws // and oh what great trouble he&#039;d<strong> cause</strong> // we built a huge pen // to keep him <em>pent in</em> // and stop him from breaking more laws //.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 5-7-2006(128): Why is there poop on the kitchen floor? Oh, the<strong> cause</strong> is that you kept the <em>dog</em> <em>pent in</em> the house all day. Next time remember to walk him.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narazumono">narazumono</a>] 16-11-2008(113): The<strong> cause</strong> of the big bang (the ultimate<strong> cause</strong>) was a very <em>large</em> amount of matter <em>pent in</em> to a point in space.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 3-7-2009(43): <strong>Cause</strong> is a difficult key word, hard to associate with a concrete image. So let &#039;cause&#039; be associated with &#039;first<strong> cause</strong>&#039;. Let this be the big bang (not worry about what<strong> cause</strong>d <em>that</em>, since people can&#039;t decide what it is so it&#039;s no use for an image). The first<strong> cause</strong>, the big bang, is represented by having something <em>large</em> (the universe) <em>pent in</em> inside a tiny space. It&#039;s about to explode and<strong> cause</strong> EVERYTHING.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/osaki">osaki</a>] 5-3-2007(16): Our<strong> cause</strong> is to rescue the pent in St. Bernard.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek">peepiceek</a>] 12-6-2008(10): The<strong> cause</strong> of the breakage was stuffing too many <em>big</em> things into a small <em>box</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 10-12-2008(7): Only for a really &quot;<em>large</em>&quot;<strong> cause</strong>, I am willing to be <em>pent in</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamboh">jamboh</a>] 21-6-2006(6): The St Bernard will remain pent up until the<strong> CAUSE</strong> of the recent spate of dog attacks has been discovered.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cricket">cricket</a>] 3-4-2008(5): WHAT IS THE<strong> CAUSE</strong> OF ALL THIS RACKET!?? The St. Bernard that is <em>pent in</em> wants out.
