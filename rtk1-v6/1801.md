heisig: "<i>Awl</i> . . . <i>saber</i>. As we promised way back in frame 87, here at last is the kanji on which the primitive element of the same name is based."
primit: "awl We include this element here because of its visible similarity to the element for bundle. Be sure to make a distinct image out of its composite ingredients: meeting . . . mouth . . . person. The stroke order follows the order of the elements exactly, but note how the person runs through the mouth. [8]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(140): If it helps, make the awl primitive <strong>ice pick</strong> instead. They&#039;re basically the same thing. This kanji is an easy David vs. Goliath story of the <strong>icepick</strong> vs. the <em>saber</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 2-7-2008(96): Every self-respecting ninja knows the story of &quot;The <em>Awl and the Sabre</em>&quot;. According to the legend, a woman once defended herself by using an <em>awl</em> against a <em>sabre</em>! She used to work all day with that <em>awl</em>. However, the bandit using the <em>sabre</em> had no skill. And thus the <em>awl</em> beat the <em>sabre</em>. And from there the saying goes : &quot;The <em>sabre</em> is powerless against the <em>awl</em>, if one can&#039;t use the <em>sabre</em>.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 20-2-2008(73): ICE PICK primitive: How do you FIT a PERSON into a tight BOX (mouth primitive)? Poke holes in him with a ICE PICK, draining the blood and making the body smaller. STORY: If that does not work, take out your<strong> SABER</strong> and cut them up into neat pieces.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 9-4-2007(58): As a non-native speaker of English, I really couldn&#039;t work with the awl primitive, since I can&#039;t even imagine what kind of tool it would be. So, I had another look at the primitive and it practically screamed a different meaning: <em>fit together</em> and <em>person</em>, i.e. Frankenstein&#039;s Monster. // The crowd came after the monster of Frankenstein with sabres!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 13-1-2011(19): My light<strong> saber</strong> has an <em>awl</em> setting. When I toggle the switch, the beam shrinks down to a little spike. My light<strong> saber</strong> becomes a light <em>awl</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 15-1-2008(14): <strong>Awl primitive</strong>: The builders&#039; meeting was fairly informal, and even included entertainment. The stunt-builder picked a <em>person</em> from the audience and invited them onto the spinning wheel, where which he&#039;d throw <strong>awls</strong> and amaze everyone with his aim by not hitting the volunteer. Unfortunately, the very first one he threw went straight into the <em>person&#039;s</em> <em>mouth</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 4-5-2009(12): <strong>Ice pick</strong>: The penguins called the Eskimos to a meeting in an ice cave. Little did they know, it was a Eskimo MASSACRE. The penguins were armed with<strong> saber</strong>s and started slaughtering innocent Eskimos. However, the Eskimo men had their <em>icepicks</em>, and started to fight back! The women and children ran as fast as they could, and <em>people fled from the mouth of the cave</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kerth">Kerth</a>] 18-4-2010(11): This kanji actually stands for anciend tsurugi type sword (<a href="http://medieval2.heavengames.com/m2tw/history/miscellaneous_history_folder/japanese_weapons_folder/tsurugi.jpg">http://medieval2.heavengames.com/m2tw/history/miscellaneous_history_folder/japanese_weapons_folder/tsurugi.jpg</a>) inspired by chinese jian (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jian">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jian</a>). Similarly to jian, and unlike 刀 (katana), tsurugi was almost exclusively used for thrusting strikes, making it truly an <em>awl</em>-type <em>saber</em>. (By the way, in Japan 剣 is also used for jian instead of traditional chinese 劍, as well as for any other double-edged broadsword).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 19-9-2006(11): Awl your<strong> saber</strong>s are belong to us.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 30-12-2008(9): An <em>ice-pick</em> is as deadly as a <em><strong>saber</strong></em> in the right hands.
