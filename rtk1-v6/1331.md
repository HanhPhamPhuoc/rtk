1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/volfy">volfy</a>] 4-4-2006(159): This <em>snare</em> isn&#039;t terribly effective, because it&#039;s swinging from a<strong> decay</strong>ing <em>tree</em>. Imagine the tree as being so<strong> decay</strong>ed that when an animal gets caught in the snare, its struggles cause the tree to collapse into a putrid mess.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-9-2007(74): [+air,charley] Trigger: <strong>decaying</strong> remains. You walk by a tree and see the <strong>decaying</strong> remains of what looks like a dead human (? hard to tell, it&#039;s been years), still trapped in a <em>bear trap</em>. Turns out that the tree itself set them out. All of its comrades were getting chopped down, so it puts out <em>bear traps</em> to en<em>snare</em> would-be choppers and lets them simply<strong> decay</strong>, and uses their remains as nutrients.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 3-7-2009(56): 枯 wither The<strong> decay</strong> of an animal in the TREE was from something caught in a SNARE.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5">Floatingweed5</a>] 8-10-2007(30): Don&#039;t use wooden snares because, as the woodsman says, &quot;They&#039;re prone to<strong> decay</strong>, and the catch gets away&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 10-7-2006(24): <strong>Tree</strong> doesn&#039;t like getting chopped. To protect himself, he&#039;s set up a <strong>snare</strong> beside him. If anybody comes to chop him down, they&#039;ll get en<strong>snare</strong>d, and he&#039;ll just let them <em>decay</em> into nutrients that <strong>Tree</strong> will consume.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 29-1-2008(18): A <em>lasso</em> on a <em>tree</em>, and a hanged man <strong>decaying</strong>. Yeech!!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 29-6-2010(15): <em>Wooden</em> <em>snares</em> will eventually<strong> decay</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kansaigaijin">kansaigaijin</a>] 20-8-2009(7): Hunters often tie a <em>snare</em> around a <em>tree</em> and then forget which tree they tied it to. Whatever they caught ends up <strong>decaying</strong> due to their forgetfulness.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 27-7-2007(6): Indiana Jones comes across a <em>tree snare</em> that has a<strong> DECAY</strong>ing corpse in it.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 6-3-2007(4): A particularly cruel way to kill an animal is to set up a <em>snare</em> next to a <em>tree</em> undergoing radioactive<strong> decay</strong>, and let the trapped animal hang next to it so it can absorb as many γ-rays as possible.
