heisig: "The simplest way to remember this character is to see it as built up from that for <i>branch</i>. The first stroke can then stand for something &quot;hanging&quot; down from the <i>branch</i>, namely its bark or <b>pelt</b>. The barb at the end of the second stroke is the only other change. Merely by concentrating on this as you write the following small cluster of characters should be enough to fix the form in your mind. By way of exception, you might doodle around with the kanji's form to see what you can come up with."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(150): A<strong> pelt</strong> is hooked on a branch. A small tent is made with a<strong> pelt</strong> and a branch planted in the ground. The mnemonic hints at the first stroke (the hanging<strong> pelt</strong>) and the hook at the end of the second stroke. This is chinese radical #107 meaning “skin”.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 14-5-2008(54): To be honest, this is one of those cases where I have found it easier to &quot;just remember it&quot; as a radical, as it occurs so frequently: 彼 （かれ him） 波 （なみ wave）and so on.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 18-4-2008(24): Davy Crocket used to hang his coon-skin<strong> PELT</strong> on a <em>branch</em> that had grown out over the edge of a <em>cliff</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 17-2-2009(16): The head from the tiger<strong> pelt</strong> is hooked over the branch (<a href="../v4/1990">tiger</a> (#1990 虎) also has this hook on it), and the tiger&#039;s tail hangs down on the left. This is Hobbes <strong>pretending</strong> to be a<strong> pelt</strong>, which makes the image not so sad. See <a href="http://ezoons.com/images/wallpapers/calvin-tree.jpg">http://ezoons.com/images/wallpapers/calvin-tree.jpg</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 13-2-2008(10): The<strong> pelt</strong> Jason travelled so far for was found <em>hanging</em> from the <em>crooked</em> <em>branch</em> of a tree, standing alone on a <em>cliff</em>.
