1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trikatu">trikatu</a>] 28-2-2007(219): You have to watch your<strong> step</strong> when moving your <em>leg</em> on a <em>watery day</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 16-5-2007(80): So, we&#039;ve walked on the moon, but it&#039;s going to take a pirate with a <em>wooden leg</em>, with a huge supply of cooling <em>water</em> to land on the <em>sun</em> and take that &quot;one small<strong> step</strong> for a man&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazato">wazato</a>] 5-11-2007(47): Use Floatingweed5&#039;s story, except, to remember the positioning of water and sun, picture the pirate pouring water into his mouth with a wagging tongue. How refreshing while doing his<strong> step</strong> aerobics.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5">Floatingweed5</a>] 10-10-2007(44): The peg leg pirate, wanting to get fit, signs up for some<strong> step</strong> aerobic classes. Here is is clutching his bottle of water and<strong> step</strong>ping up and down from his<strong> step</strong> platform in the island sunshine.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-11-2008(36): This is better remembered as &quot;step on&quot; or trample. I picture a puddle of water with the sun reflected in it (to get the water above sun positioning), then you<strong> step</strong> on the puddle with your foot to trample the image.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong">samesong</a>] 30-9-2008(29): I<strong> step</strong>ped into a puddle of <em>water</em> with my <em>wooden leg</em>, so I had to leave it out in the <em>sun</em> to dry <em>all day</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 22-3-2009(14): !!!prepare for extreme surrealism!!! on rainy days you must be careful where you place your <em>feet</em> as you can&#039;t<strong> step</strong> on puddles of <em>water</em> as you will actually fall into the reflection of the world in the puddle which means you will fall into an upside down sky and hit the sun of the reflection. Remember this world is upside down so the sun is BELOW the water of the puddle (primitive placement).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 2-2-2008(8): I do my<strong> step</strong> aerobics class on wednesdays and sundays.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 23-1-2008(7): Think Pirates of the Caribbean: a <em>peg-legged</em> pirate scratches his head in confusion at the final<strong> step</strong> on the treasure map: they have to make it so that the <em>water</em> of the ocean is above, and the <em>sun</em> is below?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 20-1-2010(5): Pirates<strong> step</strong> on WATER every DAY at the job so they often have to replace their WOODEN leg to prevent it from rotting.
