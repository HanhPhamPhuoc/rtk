heisig: "As all magicians who have passed their apprenticeship know, one makes one's <i>wand</i> out of a hazel branch and is careful not to alter the natural form of the <i>wood</i>. For the magic of the <i>wand</i> derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its <b>crude</b>, natural state."
