3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 8-12-2009(13): <strong>dread</strong>: Dread is the state of mind when you see the odd tool made of stretched human eyes.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 4-7-2011(3): A common scene in a horror/suspense film: a prisoner is made to look at a whole set of random <em>tools</em>. The prisoner&#039;s <em>state of mind</em> is really disturbed by the<strong> disquieting</strong> possibility that all these <em>tools</em> will be used to torture him. 危惧 (P); 危ぐ ; 危虞 (iK) 【きぐ】 (n,vs) fear; misgivings;.
