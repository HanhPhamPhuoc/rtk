heisig: "One of the worst problems you have to face when you go <b>hunting</b> is to <i>guard</i> your take from the <i>wild dogs</i>. If you imagine yourself failing at the task, you will probably have a stronger image than if you try to picture yourself succeeding."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 27-3-2007(186): Actually when <strong>hunting</strong> it may be a good idea to use a <em>pack of dogs</em> as your personal <em>guard</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 1-4-2008(85): After a <em>pack of wild dogs</em><strong> hunt</strong> some food, they will <em>guard</em> it fiercely.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher">tstuhldreher</a>] 7-7-2008(69): In every prison escape movie, the<strong> hunt</strong> for the escapees involves a pack of WILD DOGS unleashed by the GUARDS.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong">samesong</a>] 30-6-2008(9): In Duck<strong> Hunt</strong>, that <em>dog</em> is damned lucky the game <em>protects</em> him, or I&#039;d shot him by now.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 18-3-2008(8): Imagine: you sit in the porch of your <em>house</em>, rub your pack of <em>wild dogs</em> vigorously with <em>glue</em> and send them off to<strong> HUNT</strong> rabbits by rolling on them and returning with the poor little critters <em>glued</em> to them. Supposedly, the Russians trained dogs with mines on their backs to run under German tanks in WWII, so the idea is feasible.
