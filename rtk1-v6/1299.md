heisig: "This character is now used chiefly in proper names, and is best learned as the character closest to the hiragana え, though in fact it has no relation to it."
primit: "In order to give this kanji a more concrete meaning when it is used as a primitive element, think of it as referring to building blocks with the hiragana written on them, much the same as the A-B-C blocks you played with as a child."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 4-11-2007(292): <strong>Of</strong> all the kanji, this is the only one 之 orro can write.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 31-1-2008(110): The Z<strong> of</strong> Zorro (and yes he has a hat).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 7-2-2007(49): &quot;Hey Zorro, would you sign my chest?&quot; &quot;Why<strong> of</strong> course!&quot; Long story short: he didn&#039;t use a pen...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Groot">Groot</a>] 13-4-2010(16): The mark <strong>of</strong> 之 orro!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-1-2008(10): My kanji dictionaries state that this is an alternate kanji for これ (<strong>this one</strong>) ( 此れ being the other form). It looks like a very small <em>person</em> 人 who lifts a <em>hat</em> with his <em>arm</em>. I like to think<strong> of</strong> him as a <em>gardener</em> with a Panama Hat, but it could also be the almighty Zorro!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 25-2-2007(6): Zorro is known for slashing a &#039;Z&#039; with his sword, but nobody&#039;s impressed by that anymore. He&#039;s decided to get everyone&#039;s attention again by pouring gasoline in a hillside field to create a giant Z<strong> of</strong> fire. (The &#039;Z&#039; is to remind me which character this is, since the keyword is pretty much completely useless. Along with that, I use an adaptation<strong> of</strong> Johnny Cash -- &quot;Burnin&#039; Z<strong> of</strong> fire...&quot;).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jbudding">jbudding</a>] 27-6-2011(5): The kanji<strong> OF</strong> Zorro with his stylized <em>top hat</em> and a swoosh.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 17-2-2010(5): Marcando la 之 DE 之 orro (3 strokes).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Errol246">Errol246</a>] 20-10-2012(3): How about a stroke order, Heisig?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 31-5-2010(3): <strong>Of</strong> all the movies that abuse the &quot;X<strong> of</strong> Y&quot; title formula, 之 orro is one<strong> of</strong> the worst: &quot;Mark<strong> of</strong> Zorro&quot;, &quot;Son<strong> of</strong> Zorro&quot;, &quot;Sign<strong> of</strong> Zorro&quot;, &quot;Mask<strong> of</strong> Zorro&quot;, &quot;Legend<strong> of</strong> Zorro&quot;, &quot;Ghost<strong> of</strong> Zorro&quot;...
