1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 25-3-2007(250): Prostitutes can make a veritable <em>cornucopia</em> of<strong> income</strong> by using their <em>crotches</em> -- they put the &quot;come&quot; in &quot;income.&quot; (A bit lewd perhaps, but effective in keeping this character distinct from similar keywords like <a href="../v4/906">profit</a> (#906 利) or <a href="../v4/893">earnings</a> (#893 稼)).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 22-2-2008(85): Women love men with money. If you have a high<strong> income</strong> you can get a cornicopia of crotches.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 30-11-2008(69): <strong>STROKE ORDER WARNING:</strong> The order in which the <em>cornucopia</em> primitive is written is altered here. First the long vertical bar, then the L part in either one or two strokes (this seems to vary in different reference materials).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-9-2008(41): The <em>Fantastic Four</em> use Jessica Alba&#039;s <em>crotch</em> to gain some extra<strong> income</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slats70">slats70</a>] 4-1-2009(33): A prostitute with <em>4 crotches</em> could sure pull in a big<strong> income</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(11): On the cover of the Japanese version of “Income For Dummies” there is a picture of a Japanese businessman <em>sitting astride</em> (with his <em>crotch</em>) a <em>cornucopia</em> overflowing with money and miscellaneous goods. Think of the pose of a cowboy riding a bull, only here the Japanese businessman is trying to &quot;tame&quot; his<strong> income</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dustin_Calgary">Dustin_Calgary</a>] 10-1-2009(9): With my<strong> INCOME</strong> i have to feed 4 CROTCHES.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 3-6-2008(7): Because I only have a <em>four</em> figure<strong> income</strong>, i had to sell my crotch to get extra<strong> income</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 15-6-2010(6): Oh god, another one?... don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/893">earnings</a> (#893 稼), <a href="../v4/1349">salary</a> (#1349 給), <a href="../v4/473">assets</a> (#473 資) or <a href="../v4/194">savings</a> (#194 貯). I keep this distinct by thinking of a Jane Austen novel, where fortunes are always discussed in terms of<strong> income</strong> but never those other words. A dirty story though: those men in possession of a decent<strong> income</strong> would find a <em>cornucopia</em> of lower-aristocratic <em>crotches</em> available to them.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 9-9-2008(5): The best way to do your<strong> income</strong> tax - <em>sitting cross-legged</em> with a <em>cornucopia</em> of delicious fruits close-by.
