1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 6-9-2007(260): It&#039;s a <em>hay</em> <strong>ride</strong>! You sit on piles of <em>silage</em> and everyone likes to imitate old-time farmers with a piece of <em>wheat</em> sticking out of their mouths.

Good news for those who have <em>wheat</em> <em>silage</em> surplus.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 30-9-2009(31): The hardest part about being a farmer is when it comes to the slaughter. &quot;Come on boys, we&#039;re going for a<strong> ride</strong>!&quot; &quot;Oh boy, a<strong> ride</strong>!&quot; say the little <em>wheat</em> sprigs, hopping onto the tractor. The farmer then takes them off to become <em>silage</em>, tears in his eyes.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zz_alex_zz">zz_alex_zz</a>] 26-3-2008(17): On a farm first you <strong>ride</strong> the tractor, cut down the <em>wheat</em>, and finally mix the wheat with <em>silage</em> to make haylage. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haylage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haylage</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 21-12-2008(9): The closest the kids on the farm ever got to a fairground<strong> ride</strong> was pointing the <em>crosshair</em> of their air-rifles at the <em>wheat</em> to see who could take the head off first. (I take &#039;<em>silage</em>&#039; to mean &#039;<em>crosshair</em>&#039;)... (<em>continued in next kanji</em>).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 14-8-2009(6): Newest hybrid fuel technology! Fueled by mixture of Silage and Wheat for a renewable source to power all the sport car<strong> ride</strong>s in the world, Test drive and<strong> Ride</strong> away today!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 17-4-2013(3): The pretty farmer&#039;s daughter promised me a<strong> ride</strong> but I was gutted when I found out she meant on her father&#039;s tractor to help cut <em>wheat</em> for <em>silage</em>. She took me for a<strong> ride</strong> alright. (NB: <em>wheat</em> doubles up with one stroke of <em>silage</em>).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/digicult">digicult</a>] 16-6-2009(3): I&#039;m about to go for a<strong> ride</strong> on the shinkansen. I have my reserved ticket and everything. The train pulls into the station, the doors open, and -- what the hell -- it&#039;s full of <em>wheat silage</em>? I know JR had some budget cuts, but this is ridiculous! I don&#039;t want to<strong> ride</strong> anymore!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jasta">Jasta</a>] 4-12-2008(3): Pictograph: people who <strong>ride</strong> a train and <em>droop</em> (fall asleep) often have a waggling head (the first stroke) and sometimes they take on strange shapes like having their legs wide open (the last two strokes instead of the horizontal one in the droop kanji).
