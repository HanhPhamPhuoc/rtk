heisig: "Knowing how much dogs love to chase <b>cats</b>, picture a <i>pack of wild dogs</i> planting &quot;<b>cat</b>-<i>seedlings</i>,&quot; watering them, and fertilizing them until they can be harvested as a crop of <b>cats</b> for them to chase and torment. If you begin from the key word and think of a &quot;crop of <b>cats</b>,&quot; you will not confuse this story with the apparently similar story of two frames ago."
