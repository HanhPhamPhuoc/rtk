heisig: "Maybe this helps you see how the Japanese have no trouble keeping <b>convex</b> distinct from <i>concave</i>. Note the odd feeling of the third stroke. If it doesn't feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it."
