heisig: "This pictograph of a clenched fist is another of the &quot;hand primitives.&quot; Take note of its rather peculiar drawing. Try to think of drawing a <i>fist</i> (the primitive meaning) &quot;<b>from</b>&quot; this character to give yourself a connotation for the otherwise abstract key word."
primit: "The primitive meaning is taken from the pictograph: a fist."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 18-10-2007(218): <strong>FROM</strong> a pictograph of a thumbs up. That&#039;s how it also gets the primitive meaning of fist.
