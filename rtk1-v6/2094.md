heisig: "The only thing that distinguishes this character from that for <i>bird</i> is the omission of the one stroke that makes it <i>white</i>. Which is logical enough, when you consider that there are no <b>crows</b> of that color."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(184): The book&#039;s story is just fine, but I found a kanji dictionary explanation also interesting: As<strong> crow</strong>s are all black, it&#039;s hard to see where their eyes are (black on black), so a stroke is removed from the part in the pictograph where the eyes would be.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squeaky_lill_mk">squeaky_lill_mk</a>] 30-6-2009(59): A<strong> crow</strong> is a <em>bird</em>, but <em>not a white one</em>. MEANING: write <em>bird</em>, but skip writing <em>one</em> in <em>white</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 11-2-2010(23): When God made<strong> crow</strong>s he took away their <em>whiteness</em> and gave them big <em>mouths</em> instead.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 21-11-2008(6): The <strong>crow</strong> is a bird with a big mouth (caw! caw!) and no white feathers to be seen.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nick65765">Nick65765</a>] 16-6-2012(4): <strong>Crow</strong>s are not white birds. brilliant.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biene">Biene</a>] 19-5-2012(3): The story in the book is good, but I like to add another twist. In the old times the black <strong>crows</strong> and ravens were sometimes used as pets. When their tongue had been cut loose to get more movement, they were actually able to learn to say words, just like a parrot. So here I see a <em>bird</em> which has a real <em>mouth</em> to talk with, and no <em>white</em> in it&#039;s plumage whatsoever. And trust me, since <strong>crows</strong> are very smart <em>birds</em> it&#039;ll make good use of that <em>mouth</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 12-9-2008(2): The<strong> CROW</strong> is not a white bird!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiHantaa">KanjiHantaa</a>] 21-4-2013(1): El <strong>cuervo</strong> no es un <em>pájaro</em> níveo, pero sí que tiene una gran <em>bocota</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 8-4-2013(1): A<strong> crow</strong> is a <em>bird</em> alright, just not a <em>white one</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 30-7-2009(1): They were discriminating against the black<strong> crow</strong>s when they wrote this kanji, so they took away <em>one</em> point. Why can&#039;t it have the same rights as white birds? =[.
