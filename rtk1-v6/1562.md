2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 1-11-2007(79): The <em>slaves</em> are <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> when the<strong> oversee</strong>r comes in. They tell him &quot;We&#039;re not goofing off, a <em>dish</em> fell and broke and we&#039;re cleaning it off the <em>floor</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 20-3-2008(35): While the slave-buyer is perusing (<a href="../v4/855">perusal</a> (#855 覧)) the stack of <strong>slaves reclining on the floor</strong>, the slaves&#039;<strong> oversee</strong>r supplies them with <strong>dishes</strong> of gruel -- don&#039;t want the slaves starving to death before they can be sold!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-10-2005(18): Mnemonic : &quot;The<strong> oversee</strong>r<strong> oversee</strong>s that the <em>slaves</em> are washing the <em>dishes</em> instead of <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> (having a siesta)&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 6-2-2008(10): The plantation master<strong> oversee</strong>s his slaves crawling on the floor and eating from the same plate.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 6-8-2009(9): The <strong>overseer&#039;s</strong> job is easy - he watches the <em>slave</em> while <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em>, observing the slave washing the <em>dishes</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drkdve">drkdve</a>] 17-3-2010(7): &quot;You got time to lean? You got time to clean!&quot; is your catch phrase when you<strong> oversee</strong> the kitchen staff. It&#039;s to make sure that no <em>slaves</em> start <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> when they should be doing <em>dishes</em>. [re: dingomick].

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 14-3-2007(5): To<strong> oversee</strong> is to protect and watch over. But it can also be viewed as being <em>enslaved</em> by that which you must<strong> oversee</strong>. Here are the Knights Templar who must<strong> oversee</strong> the <em>Holy Grail</em>, they are <em>enslaved</em> by this task throughout time. Image: A Templar Knight <em>reclining on the floor</em> holding the precious <em>Holy Grail</em> with a look of wizened sadness on his face.

Please be silent or you may disturb the air flow&quot;.
