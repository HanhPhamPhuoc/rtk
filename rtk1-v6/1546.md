1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 28-8-2006(151): The<strong> waver</strong> for this kanji means to hesitate. I<strong> waver</strong>ed before going into the bar with a bunch of horned wild dogs drinking whiskey straight out of the bottle.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 26-8-2008(81): Tip: <em>horns</em> + <em>whiskey bottle</em> : This combination of primitives appears five times in Heisig, including as a separate kanji 酋 <a href="../v4/2906">chieftain</a> (#2906 酋). REF: <a href="../v4/1439">revered</a> (#1439 尊), <a href="../v4/2425">courtesy</a> (#2425 鄭), <a href="../v4/2493">Japanese oak</a> (#2493 楢). Edit: Note that in some fonts <em>horns</em> are replaced by <em>eight</em> 八 .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela">Wakela</a>] 11-9-2007(80): . Have you ever had Wild Dog brand whiskey? That stuff is downright evil. So evil, the bottle has horns, and you need to sign a<strong> waver</strong> before you drink it. Because of this warning you will surely<strong> waver</strong> as you bring the shot glass to your lips.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bladethecoder">bladethecoder</a>] 2-6-2010(34): I<strong> waver</strong>ed when the <em>pack of wild dogs</em> was blocking the way, but then I drank some <em>Red Bull</em> and charged through. (thanks shakkun).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imojyochu">imojyochu</a>] 15-9-2008(18): She<strong> waver</strong>ed in going to bed with me until she had a few drinks and then she was horny as a wild dog.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 7-12-2011(16): &quot;and <strong>furthermore</strong>,&quot; continued the sermon, &quot;you can turn into <em>wild dogs</em> and grow <em>horns</em> if your resolution <strong>wavers</strong> with the <em>whiskey</em> bottle&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 8-5-2009(11): The <a href="../v4/2906">chieftain</a> (#2906 酋) did not<strong> waver</strong> and fought against a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> to proctect his people.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 31-7-2009(8): A clever animal is being hunted by a <em>pack of wild dogs</em>. It puts a pair of <em>horns</em> on a <em>whisky bottle</em> and leaves that behind as a decoy. The dogs don&#039;t fall for the decoy, they see it&#039;s a whisky bottle, but still they<strong> waver</strong>. Should they let their quarry go and just drink the whisky?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 21-7-2009(8): You&#039;d<strong> waver</strong> too if you came across a pack of <em>wild dogs</em> all hopped up on <em>Red Bull</em>.
