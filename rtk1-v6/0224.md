heisig: "Recalling that <b>books</b> are made of paper, and paper made of <i>trees</i>, one might think of a <b>book</b> as a slice of a <i>tree</i>. Can you seethe &quot;cross-cut&quot; in the trunk of the <i>tree</i>? Picture it as a chainsaw cutting you out a few <b>books</b> with which to start your own private library."
