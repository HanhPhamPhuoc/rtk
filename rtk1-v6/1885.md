4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 10-8-2008(18): This kanji does not mean &quot;romance&quot; such as romantic love. Here is a common saying:&quot; <a href="http://google.com/#q=恋は追いかけるもの、愛は受け入れるもの">恋は追いかけるもの、愛は受け入れるもの</a> .&quot; 恋 means a love that you chase passionately. You are not necessarily loved back, or who you love does not know, in a sense. 愛 however does mean a mutual love, or &quot;romance&quot; between two people. (if you disagree E-mail me) STORY: You fell in LOVE with someone but they told you they don&#039;t love you. Now you wish you had that poison APPLE to stop your HEART.
