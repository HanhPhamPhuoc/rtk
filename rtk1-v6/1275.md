1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 31-1-2010(209): <strong>Commoner</strong>s have to huddle in <em>caverns around a campfire</em>, while higher class people get heating and central air conditioning in a hotel.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 14-12-2009(58): PRIMITIVE: <em>Cave</em> + <em>twenty</em> = <strong>Finnish sauna</strong> (instead of Heisig&#039;s &quot;caverns&quot;, which I&#039;d confuse with &quot;cave&quot;). This primitive meaning works well for all kanji it occurs in; I&#039;ve posted stories for all of them. STORY: Wealthy people have a <em>sauna</em> in their house, but<strong> commoner</strong>s have to use their <em>oven fire</em> to warm themselves.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-2-2006(25): I draw upon The Two Towers again. Imagine the scene where the people of rohan seeks refuge in the cavernous fortress of Helms Cleft. The nobility and warriors stand ground at the bulwark, where as the<strong> commoner</strong> stay behind in the huge caverns of 20 little fireplaces.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 15-9-2008(10): A<strong> commoner</strong> is forced to huddle around a fire in a cavern for warmth.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(7): Caverns suggest the labyrinth of Crete and the myth of the <em>Minotaur</em>. Each year, the villagers have to sacrifice a virgin<strong> commoner</strong> to the minotaur. He then roasts the young woman on his <em>cooking fire</em>. This year the<strong> commoner</strong> is Barbara Walters.

Basically, it&#039;s a <em>cavern</em> with <em>20</em> available <em>caves</em> for rent where you can prepare your meals on a shared <em>cooking fire</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 20-1-2010(5): I was having trouble remembering cavern so I think of them being TWENTY times the size of a CAVE.
