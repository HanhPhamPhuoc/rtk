1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 13-3-2007(158): The <em>director</em>&#039;s <em>mouth</em> dropped open as he flipped through the <em>scrapbook</em> of properties he was about to become <strong>heir</strong> to.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 27-2-2008(78): Careful with <a href="../v4/1370">inherit</a> (#1370 継). The egoistic <em>director</em> leaves instructions about what shall be handed down to his<strong> heir</strong> upon the director&#039;s death. First, the director&#039;s <em>mouth</em> should be surgically removed and preserved, to be handed down to his<strong> heir</strong>. Second, a scrapbook of the director&#039;s proudest scenes should also be handed down. The <em>mouth</em> reminds the<strong> heir</strong> that the <em>director</em> must be a loudmouth; the <em>scrapbook</em> reminds the<strong> heir</strong> of how to be a good director.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 15-7-2008(41): This kanji must be referring to Harry Potter. Is he the<strong> heir</strong> to Slytherin? Who knows? His <em>mouth</em> speaks parseltongue though, and Voldemort is trying to kill him from a magical <em>scrapbook</em>.. (or was that a diary? haha). Oh, and the <em>director</em> of the potions department hates him. Poor harry!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 17-8-2008(21): The <em>director&#039;s</em> son will be<strong> heir</strong> to a big <em>mouth</em> and a <em>scrapbook</em> full of directing instructions.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 21-8-2010(10): The<strong> heir</strong> opened his <em>mouth</em> in shock when the <em>director</em> of the estate told him he was only getting a <em>scrapbook</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 5-8-2009(8): The<strong> heir</strong> opened his <em>mouth</em> (to speak) and his <em>scrapbook</em> to prove that he was the son of the late <em>director</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 25-4-2007(7): The<strong> heir</strong> has a magical <em>scrapbook</em> with a <em>mouth</em> that <em>directs</em> him at all times so he doesn&#039;t make any faux pas.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vertigo959">vertigo959</a>] 7-11-2008(6): When director <em>Steven Speilberg</em> lost the use of his <em>mouth</em>, he could no longer work, so he put all his movie ideas down in a <em>scrapbook</em> to give to his<strong> heir</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 18-3-2010(4): On his deathbed, the monarch put his <em>mouth</em> to the ear of his<strong> heir</strong> and whispered, &quot;the secrets are in the <em>scrapbook</em>...study it well to become the <em>director</em> of our empire&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 1-10-2007(4): In <em>Hitchcock&#039;s</em> adaptation of Hamlet, Hamlet, who was<strong> heir</strong> to the throne, finds out his father was poisoned by his uncle by looking through an old <em>scrapbook</em>. When he sees the picture of the poisoning, his <em>mouth</em> drops open. [Thanks guidedog].
