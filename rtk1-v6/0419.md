heisig: "This character is a kind of pictographic image of how <b>prolonging</b> is a clever way of <i>stopping</i> things by trying to <i>stretch</i> them out a little bit at a time (the extra <i>drop</i> at the top of <i>stop</i>). Be sure to get a concrete image of this process, by imagining yourself <b>prolonging</b> something you can really, physically, <i>stretch</i>."
