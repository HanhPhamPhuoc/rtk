heisig: "<i>Ten</i> . . . <i>rice fields</i> . . . <i>glue</i>. That is how one would read the primitive elements of this kanji from top to bottom. Now if we make a simple sentence out of these elements, we get: &quot;<i>Ten rice fields glued</i> together.&quot; A <b>specialty</b>, of course, refers to one's special &quot;<i>field</i>&quot; of endeavor or competence. In fact, few people remain content with a single <b>specialty</b> and usually extend themselves in other <i>fields</i> as well. This is how we come to get the picture of <i>ten fields glued</i> together to represent a <b>specialty</b>."
