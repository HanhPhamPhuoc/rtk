heisig: "This character is composed of two primitive elements, <i>mouth</i> and <i>human legs</i>,  both of which we will meet in the coming lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the &quot;story&quot; connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top-to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast."

First the giant bites off the person&#039;s head, then he bites the torso, then from the waist to the knees, and finally the giant plucks up the remaining portion of the human legs into his mouth. See the<strong> four</strong>th bite falling in there?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanji55">kanji55</a>] 29-4-2008(36): This is a picture of a slab in the morgue. It is pulled out from the drawer, and it is showing only the dead person&#039;s feet. Clearly <em>shi</em> means DEATH.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiteru">xiteru</a>] 9-10-2007(22): A man inside<strong> four</strong> walls.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 16-12-2007(19): <strong>Four</strong> are the <em>legs</em> of the Schrödinger Cat, which is kept in a <em>box</em>, and you don&#039;t know if the cat is dead or alive until you open it.
