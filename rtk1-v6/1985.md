2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-7-2007(79): Even the <em>tall</em> <em>kids</em> can&#039;t get out of the<strong> enclosure</strong> that is the <em>city walls</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 26-5-2009(15): This Kanji also has the meaning of <strong>red-light district</strong> (probably an abbreviation from <a href="../v4/2235">licensed quarters</a> (#2235 廓)). Only <em>tall kids</em> are allowed to go there and leave the<strong> enclosure</strong> through the <em>city wall</em> to <em>receive</em> what they need so desperately.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ma3xiu1">ma3xiu1</a>] 4-5-2010(4): To keep the <em>tall kids</em> in the<strong> enclosure</strong>, a normal playpen won&#039;t do, you need to have <em>city walls</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>] 25-7-2009(4): Mister Burns&#039; <em>receives</em> a notice whenever <em>tall kids</em> enter the<strong> enclosure</strong> of his domain.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 26-4-2009(4): <em>Mr. Burns</em> <em>receives</em> a notice whenever someone passes through the walls that act as an<strong> enclosure</strong> around his home so that he knows to release the hounds.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/proagg">proagg</a>] 27-3-2009(4): The<strong> enclosure</strong> that has <em>received</em> the most attention is <em>The Great Wall of China</em>.
