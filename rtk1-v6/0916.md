1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 9-12-2009(47): If you have a weak<strong> KIDNEY</strong>, you&#039;ll become a SLAVE to your CROTCH&#039;s need to pee. Oh well, it&#039;s just a weakness of the FLESH.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 16-11-2008(36): When the <em>sex slave</em> misbehaves, threaten to sell his <em>body parts</em> starting with his<strong> kidney</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 11-1-2009(9): If you become a <em>slave</em> to your <em>crotch</em> and play with your <em>flesh</em> every night, that <em>part of your body</em> will think it no longer needs to be used for peeing, and that is how you get<strong> kidney</strong> failure.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(6): Needing more money, the <em>slave</em> sold this <em>body part</em> in addition to her <em>crotch</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BladeWalker">BladeWalker</a>] 16-7-2012(4): The<strong> kidney</strong>s are a filtering system for blood that removes waste and diverts it to the urinary system. In other words,<strong> kidney</strong>s are a <em>part of the body</em> that acts like a <em>retainer</em> for your <em>crotch</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjiwarrior">kanjiwarrior</a>] 5-6-2009(3): I payed for a sex slave wearing nothing but jeans in Thailand and I woke up in a tub filled with ice, missing a<strong> kidney</strong>. ジン.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(2): I know this is really gross, but here&#039;s what I saw: Some <em>slaves</em> were made to be living <strong>kidney</strong> donors: you can see the doctors cutting the guy&#039;s <em>crotch</em> open with no anesthesia, his <em>body</em> writhing in pain as his <strong>kidneys</strong> are forcibly removed... (I think I just lost my appetite.).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 12-5-2008(2): <em>Slave</em> to the <em>crotch</em> is a sin of the <em>flesh</em>, which must be cured by removing the <strong>kidney</strong>, or so people believed. No kidding.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 14-2-2008(2): No nice Steak and<strong> Kidney</strong> pies for <em>slaves</em>, oh no! The only <em>flesh</em> they get is <em>Crotch</em>, for a Crotch and<strong> Kidney</strong> pie, eerrghh!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiwiburner">kiwiburner</a>] 15-8-2012(1): Go for the<strong> kidney</strong> if a <em>sex slave</em> (that is, a <em>slave</em> whose <em>crotch</em> is important) misbehaves again, that is the <em>part of the body</em> that really hurts.
