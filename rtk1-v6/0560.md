1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat">zwarte_kat</a>] 15-4-2007(360): A<strong> butterfly</strong> is an insect that appears after spending a generation on a tree as a cocoon.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-2-2008(44): Tip: New primitive: Let <em>Tarzan</em> = <em>generation</em> + <em>tree</em> -- because <em>Tarzan</em> lives with several <em>generation</em>s of his family at the top of a <em>tree</em>. (This combination appears five times: <a href="../v4/228">leaf</a> (#228 葉),<strong> butterfly</strong>, (FRAME 521), <a href="../v4/2158">chatter</a> (#2158 喋), <a href="../v4/2726">secret agent</a> (#2726 諜), <a href="../v4/2926">label</a> (#2926 牒)). Story: You see <em>Tarzan</em> swinging from tree to tree chasing an <em>insect</em>. Later he shows it to you neatly pinned into his<strong> butterfly</strong> collection.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 15-6-2007(36): Butterflies are insects that like to eat just the flowers but leave the leaves behind. (helps me to think of the kanji for leaves, minus the flower bit).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 4-1-2008(17): If an ugly <em>insect</em> can spend many <em>generations</em> in a <em>tree</em>, it will emerge as a beautiful<strong> butterfly</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wilsoncb">wilsoncb</a>] 4-2-2009(12): Imagine a tree which is weighed down, so much that its bending over, perhaps, by GENERATIONS of accumulated cocoons (this also helps place generation over tree). You know which INSECT is responsible: the<strong> butterfly</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-2-2007(7): A<strong> butterfly</strong> is proudly showing you his <em>insect family tree</em>. (Image: Another excellent Far Side comic: &quot;And this is Edna. Oh! And this is my great-uncle Monroe. He&#039;s a monarch!&quot;).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 7-1-2012(6): I would avoid using any cocoon imagery here, to prevent any confusion when the <em>cocoon</em> primitive is introduced (just before <a href="../v4/1378">infancy</a> (#1378 幼)). (lernsky+wasurenaide): A <strong>butterfly</strong> is (in this example) an <em>insect</em> that eats the <em>flowers</em> off of leaves (<a href="../v4/228">leaf</a> (#228 葉)).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jinkouchinou">jinkouchinou</a>] 9-6-2009(6): A<strong> butterfly</strong> is an <em>insect</em> that usually lays its cocoons (their new <em>generation</em>) in the top of <em>trees</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 6-4-2008(5): Picture Sir David Attenborough standing next to one of those <em>trees</em> where Monarch <strong>Butterflies</strong> go to mate. &quot;For <em>generations</em>&quot;, he says, &quot;these <em>insects</em> have been coming to these <em>trees</em> to reproduce.&quot; Image: <a href="http://www.pinguicula.org/A_world_of_Pinguicula_2/Fernando/February28/Fernando26">http://www.pinguicula.org/A_world_of_Pinguicula_2/Fernando/February28/Fernando26</a>(HR).jpg.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/I_pity_the_fool">I_pity_the_fool</a>] 21-12-2008(4): 葉 is leaves. Butterflies have come along and eaten all the flowers, so add the insect radical and remove the flower radical.
