heisig: "This kanji reverses the element for <i>sprout</i>, giving the image of roots being sent down into the earth by a seed planted in the <i>rice field</i>. From there you must invent a connection to the keyword, <b>armor</b>."
primit: "The primitive meaning is roots. Important to that word is the image of &quot;pushing downwards,&quot; as roots do."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 20-1-2006(200): Funny.. this appeared to me as a pictograph of a samurai&#039;s<strong> armor</strong>. Then I looked up images of the samurai<strong> armor</strong> and it is not even remotely similar. Then I realised it looks in fact like the belly of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which I somehow associated with the samurai<strong> armor</strong> because of the &quot;turtle samurai&quot; that appeared earlier. Fits me. The bit that pokes down is to protect the genitals, I guess.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 21-11-2007(156): It looks like a bird&#039;s eye view of a tank (modern<strong> armor</strong>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 22-8-2006(60): Pictograph. Kendo visor with chin guard.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wile_e42">Wile_e42</a>] 17-4-2008(36): Armour weighs you down like you’re rooted to the ground.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(14): Looks like an<strong> armor</strong>ed helmet. You have the part that protects the <em>brain</em> and a little line beneath that acts as a nose guard.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shirahime">shirahime</a>] 23-10-2008(9): To me this<strong> armor</strong> looks like a giant fly swatter, so I imagine someone running round covered in flyswatters for<strong> armor</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 22-5-2006(7): Futuristic<strong> armor</strong>ed vehicle in the fields sending roots to the ground to prevent it from being blown away by heavy artillery (the<strong> armor</strong> is strong enough to withstand almost any attack).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lankydan">lankydan</a>] 23-8-2007(5): Image is too abstract. Image:<strong> Armor</strong> being held up by walking stick in rice field. See it stands out and the<strong> armor</strong> distinguishes it from other rice fields.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 23-5-2006(5): TREEBEARD&#039;S<strong> ARMOR</strong> is made of ROOTS.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 16-9-2010(4): Pushing ROOTS down, this is the <em>rice field&#039;s</em> best<strong> armor</strong> against the oncoming typhoons. They can no longer afford to be just sprouts.
