heisig: "Here we think of <b>plug</b> in the sense of a cork or stopper used to seal the mouth of a bottle, water faucet, or something with liquid running out of it. Forgetting the abstract picture of the former frame, let us work with all the primitive units: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>ball</i>. Imagine a <i>tree</i> with a faucet in the side out of which tennis <i>balls</i> are flowing, bouncing all over the ground by the hundreds. You fight your way up to it and shove your giant beach <i>umbrella</i> into the <i>tree</i> to <b>plug</b> it up."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 12-10-2007(155): The fat <em>king</em> under his <em>umbrella</em> offers useless advice to the workers. &quot;You&#039;ll need the <em>whole</em> <em>tree</em> to<strong> plug</strong> that gap&quot;. Imagine a grossly fat, incompetent king under a parasol giving annoying advice to sweating workers who know what they&#039;re doing. (I always have trouble bringing up the &quot;whole&quot; primitive. This story reminds me how to build that part. ).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 12-11-2007(92): To<strong> plug</strong> the hole, you need to use a <em>whole</em> piece of <em>wood</em> - like a cork or something.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wreckz">wreckz</a>] 22-2-2008(75): Best example of a<strong> plug</strong> is a cork. A piece of <em>wood</em> that covers the <em>whole</em> opening (else it would leak).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jared">Jared</a>] 11-2-2008(34): Trees and umbrellas are some king sized butt<strong> plug</strong>s. Ouch.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 24-4-2010(28): To<strong> plug</strong> the hole in the dam, use the <strong>whole</strong> damn <strong>tree</strong>.
