heisig: "<i>Rake</i> . . . <i>rice</i> . . . <i>fenceposts</i>. Take special care to draw this character in the same order as the primitive. Note too, that the fourth stroke for <i>rice</i> is already taken care of by the fourth stroke of <i>rake</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-9-2007(261): Even though it&#039;s a maddening task, the monks stay <strong>solemn</strong> as they rake <em>rice</em> between the <em>fenceposts</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 7-4-2008(169): <strong>Note:</strong> This is not <em>sieve</em> as it has a full <em>rice</em> and not <em>rice grains</em> and the hook is missing from <em>rake</em>. Also the given stroke order is incorrect (<em>fenceposts</em> should come last).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 27-6-2009(42): This is a zen rice garden. It is different from rock garden in only one aspect. Here you see <em>raked</em> white <em>rice</em> between the <em>fenceposts</em>. In<strong> solemn</strong> silence the monks rake rice every morning.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 10-8-2007(33): I tie CONDI RICE in between two FENCEPOSTS and prepare for the<strong> SOLEMN</strong> task ahead....beating her over the head with a RAKE.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 7-4-2009(22): The RICE thrown at the wedding must be RAKED up before the<strong> SOLEMN</strong> funeral procession enters between the FENCE POSTS.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 23-8-2010(10): I see this as a very formalized<strong> solemn</strong> version of the <em>sieve</em> primitive. The use of the full <em>rice</em> is more<strong> solemn</strong> than the typical quick dots of <em>rice grains,</em> while the lack of the hook also shows the slow careful unabbreviated drawing of the character. Finally, the use of <em>fenceposts</em> to reinforce the filtering meaning of sieves completes the most formal<strong> solemn</strong> version of the character. Of course, using a sieve to filter out otherwise-worthy candidates is a<strong> solemn</strong> activity.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 27-4-2007(10): The <strong>solemn</strong> budhist monk, <strong>solemnly</strong> set the <em>rake</em> for the <em>rice</em> straight between the <em>fence posts</em>, and then <strong>solemnly</strong> bowed to it.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 18-12-2007(8): Image: American base at Guantanamo Bay. The alleged terrorists sit <strong>solemnly</strong> between the <em>fenceposts</em>. From time to time, their <em>American</em> guards hit them over the head with a <em>rake</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kazuna">kazuna</a>] 10-1-2009(6): RAKE -&gt; FULL RICE -&gt; FENCE POSTS: Had I lived in Asia while growing up, instead of raking leaves every late autumn, I would be RAKING -&gt; THE FULL RICE -&gt; in between the FENCE POSTS where they are collected and stored. Whether it be raking leaves or raking race... a<strong> SOLEMN</strong> task indeed.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peacemik">peacemik</a>] 3-9-2008(5): As part of their daily torture, the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay must<strong> solemn</strong>ly swear to stay<strong> solemn</strong> as they do the senseless task of <em>raking</em> <em>rice</em> between <em>fenceposts</em>. Otherwise, they are tied between the <em>fenceposts</em> and hit with <em>rakes</em> by their <em>USA</em> guards.
