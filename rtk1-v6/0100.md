heisig: "Probably the one thing most <i>children</i> fear more than anything else is the dentist's chair. Once a <i>child</i> has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word <b>cavity</b>, even though it is not likely to know that the word means &quot;hole&quot; until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny <i>hooks</i> the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back."
