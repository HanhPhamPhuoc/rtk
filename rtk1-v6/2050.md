1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 14-3-2007(222): To get someone to <em>completely</em> <strong>acquiesce</strong> it takes <em>3</em> dunks in the <em>water</em> before they give.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 25-10-2007(87): To get someone to<strong> acquiesce</strong>, duck them <em>completely</em> in <em>aqua</em> (=<em>water</em>) <em>three</em> times. (variation on dingomick&#039;s).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 8-7-2008(42): Warning, Obscene!! I finally got my girl to<strong> acquiesce</strong> to a lewd act.. But it took <em>3 times</em> to get it in <em>completely</em> and lots of <em>water</em> to clean up afterwards.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 28-4-2008(17): You must ask the trapped <em>water sprite</em> not once, not twice, but <em>thrice</em> (a line from Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#039;s &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; comes to mind) before it will<strong> acquiesce</strong> to your requests. It&#039;s not for any mystical reasons, it&#039;s just that it hates being asked the same thing <em>three</em> times, like that character from Austin Powers.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 30-11-2009(16): Waterboarding: To <em>completely</em><strong> acquiesce</strong> it usually takes just <em>three</em> sessions with <em>water</em>. (Thanks to dingomick for the idea.).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 8-5-2008(10): Princess Bride: scene with Fezzik dunking Inigo Montoya (three times) until he<strong> acquiesce</strong>s to completely stop drinking and find the Man in Black.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Qroxxy">Qroxxy</a>] 7-8-2009(6): Elizabeth was disinclined to<strong> acquiesce</strong> to Barbosa’s request until he dunked her <em>complete</em>ly in the bilge<em>water</em> <em>three</em> times. (I know this story makes me a dork, but the line from the movie is all that pops into my head now when I hear the word “acquiesce.”).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 13-7-2009(5): This is a baptism submersion ritual. The <em>baby</em> should be <em>completely</em> submerged in the <em>water</em> <em>three</em> times . Quote from wikipedia: Eastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on <em>complete</em> <em>three</em>fold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism</a>). Of course, the <em>baby</em> (is on the receiving end) and has no other option, but to<strong> acquiesce</strong>. + receive is the other meaning of 承 .

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 9-2-2010(4): After being <em>water</em> boarded for <em>three</em> days, the prisoner was willing to<strong> acquiesce</strong> <em>completely</em>.
