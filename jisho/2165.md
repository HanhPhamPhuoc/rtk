7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 24-1-2011(): Come a little closer and let me <strong>spin you a tale</strong>. Let me give you the low down brown. Watch my <em>mouth</em> to see what is <em>new</em> magoo. Let me give you the scoop daddy poop.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 20-1-2011(): In order to make my child eat his <em>red pepper</em>, I decided to <strong>spin a tale</strong> about the boy who refused to eat his <em>red pepper</em>, so his parent took an <em>axe</em>, and swung it at his <em>mouth</em>, tearing half his head off. Of course, I didn&#039;t have problems with my child after that! Also, this kanji has some kind of inner logic, as <strong>spinning a tale</strong> is actually <em>new</em> things coming out of your <em>mouth</em>, so you can use that as well, I guess.
