heisig: "A <i>fire</i> belongs IN the <i>hearth</i>, not OVER it. When the <i>fire</i> spreads to the rest of the house, we have an <b>inflamed</b> house. And as with any <b>inflammation</b>&nbsp;- including those that attack our bodies - the danger is always that it might spread if not checked. This is the sense behind the reduplication of element for <i>fire</i>, one atop the other."
