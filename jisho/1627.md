## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 28-5-2007(309): Forgetting about the moat, the king stepped out of his gate and landed in the water. Needless to say he got<strong> wet</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nyquil">nyquil</a>] 10-4-2007(87): (I had the same idea as Dingomick) I imagine some prankster who put a bucket full of <em>water</em> on top of the huge <em>gates</em>, so that it would fall on the <em>king</em> as he came through them. See the king now, between the gates, all<strong> wet</strong>, dripping <em>drops of water</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-9-2008(26): If I was <em>king</em>, I would be<strong> wet</strong> with the <em>water</em> of <em>lesbians</em> rubbing all over me.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 6-3-2007(21): Some prankster threw <em>water</em> on the <em>king</em> as he came to the city gates. Now he&#039;s all <strong>wet</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Airymon">Airymon</a>] 25-4-2008(13): I immediately thought of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Imagine <em>King</em> Arthur standing in front of the <em>gate</em> shortly before the end of the movie. When he demands to be let in by the French, they throw dung on him and Belvedere and they get<strong> wet</strong>. (Think of the dung as <em>water</em> in this case, it&#039;s liquid anyway) <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs">http://youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs</a> The scene I thought of is at the end of the vid.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 11-5-2008(12): Any KING arriving at the GATES of Hell gets special treatment, he is dunked in the magic WATER outside the gates which will always keep him<strong> WET</strong>. Seemingly a gift to help endure the furnaces of hell, it however only proves to be torture with the other inmates constantly trying to get to his<strong> wet</strong> clothes and a brief solace from the roasting heat.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matzsche">Matzsche</a>] 30-4-2010(7): When my king is coming out of the gates, the Japanese girls getting all<strong> WET</strong>!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 20-9-2006(5): It was <em>Watergate</em> that brought down &quot;<em>King</em>&quot; Richard the Lyin&#039; Hearted&#039;s (Pres. Nixon) &quot;kingdom&quot;. &quot;<em>King</em>&quot;Nixon walked away from the Whitehouse (actually flew away in his helicopter) like a<strong> wet</strong> puppy with his tail between his legs.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 6-6-2011(4): <em>Bill Gates</em>, the self-proclaimed <em>king</em> of software, was hit by a <em>watery</em> pie and left all<strong> wet</strong>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpCMJ2xlLfo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpCMJ2xlLfo</a>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beneus">Beneus</a>] 30-1-2009(4): A prank played on the <em>king</em>: A bucket of <em>water</em> is placed on the <em>gate</em>, so when the king goes through it, in all his elegance, the bucket falls and the <em>king</em> gets soaking<strong> wet</strong>. The peasants all find it hilarious.
