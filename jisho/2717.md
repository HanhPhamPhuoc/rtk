## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-7-2007(68): It might sound simple to bribe someone, but then you have to<strong> graft</strong> the guy above him and the guy below him, and soon you&#039;re just giving <em>shells</em> to <em>each</em> and everyone!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag">hunchbag</a>] 7-9-2011(10): <em>Graft: the acquisition of money, gain, or advantage by dishonest, unfair, or illegal means, especially through the abuse of one&#039;s position or influence in politics, business, etc. .</em> <em>STORY:</em> The evil corporate extortionist<strong> graft</strong>s all who get within his power. He<strong> GRAFT</strong>s a different amount of MONEY from EACH of his victims. If they have more, he extorts more. He even plots it out on an evil graph!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/doviende">doviende</a>] 23-10-2011(6): <strong>Graft</strong> is like bribing. You have to give <em>MONEY</em> to <em>EACH</em> person. There&#039;s a guy with a briefcase full of money and a walky-talky, and he&#039;s going around asking on the walky-talky about who he should give money too. &quot;This guy gets money? Roger.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 30-10-2009(5): I take this to mean the verb<strong> graft</strong>, and so simply see a bunch of shellfish being <strong>grafted</strong> onto <em>each</em> other, <em>each</em> to <em>each</em>.

Note: I changed the keyword to extort because it is much easier to remember than this strange definition of<strong> graft</strong> and has a similar meaning.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 26-9-2010(3): 賄賂 <a href="../2738">graft</a> (#2738 賂) ロ( 路 ) ... Parts: 貝 , 各 or 貝 , ( 路 - 足 ) ...

Story:Removing the <strong>grafted</strong> on <em>pegleg</em> and replacing it with money makes the <em>path</em> go smoother; that&#039;s why they call it greasing the skids. Of course it is <strong>graft</strong>, but that&#039;s just the way to get things done. <em>Each</em> person gets some, and things get done. ... cf: 駱駝.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 7-7-2012(1): Once you give into<strong> graft</strong>, soon you have to <em>shell</em> it out to <em>each</em> and every one whe finds out.
