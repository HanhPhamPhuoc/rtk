## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-1-2007(340): Ok, this is a little wierd, but i took this back to the kanji for <a href="../254">pagoda</a> (#254 塔). I think it helps simplify the image, and also helps anchor the pagoda kanji in memory better as an added bonus. say this aloud once, and i think it will bring out a vivid image very quickly: &quot;Now<strong> board</strong>ing the <em>pagoda</em> ride. Please keep your <em>fingers</em> inside at all times...&quot;.
