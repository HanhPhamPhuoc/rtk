## Koohii stories:

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 17-7-2006(31): He was <strong>starving</strong> for <em>food</em>, but he had too much <em>ego</em> and was too proud to ask for <em>food</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 5-4-2009(18): A group of high class chefs were trapped in a fast food restaurant. They had such a big ego, they refused to eat any hamburgers, and they all<strong> starve</strong>d to death.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 10-6-2009(9): People use the phrase &quot;I&#039;m starving&quot; too casually. They just want some FOOD, and their EGO causes them to magnify their terminology for effect.

I was really hungry, and new that I should just have popped down the local <em>McDonalds</em> for a burger, but I was just so busy giving myself a <em>hand fiesta</em> that I totally forgot to feed myself, and now I&#039;ve<strong> starve</strong>d to death. I guess what Daddy always said about the perils of <em>hand fiestas</em> was true.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 7-2-2010(4): The only <em>food</em> he eats is <em>Ego</em> waffles. He&#039;d<strong> starve</strong> without them!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/childofthetao">childofthetao</a>] 28-7-2011(3): <em>Feed</em> the <em>ego</em>,<strong> starve</strong> the soul.
