3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 23-6-2008(72): Hint: this is<strong> faint</strong> as in dim, weak or indistinct, not the verb.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 5-11-2006(41): <strong>Two cocoons</strong> set out to climb a <strong>mountain</strong>, but they get separated. They shout to each other, but their voices, blocked by the mountain, are so <em>faint</em>. Notice that the first stroke of <strong>mountain</strong> is first, followed by the 2 <strong>cocoons</strong>, then the conclusion of <strong>mountain</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BooBooQ88">BooBooQ88</a>] 1-8-2009(9): All the Japanese people<strong> FAINT</strong>ED when they found out that there were 2 Mothra cocoons on the mountain.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 28-4-2007(6): A close pair of twin-brother caterpillars were separated during metamorphosis, and their <em>cocoons</em> were placed on <em>opposite sides of a mountain</em>. Will they be reunited one day, having <strong>faintly</strong> recognized each other? Or will their separation traumatize them so much that they <strong>seclude</strong> themselves forever?
