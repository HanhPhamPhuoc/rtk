2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TalkTalk">TalkTalk</a>] 13-8-2009(102): _potentially offensive (sorry): It&#039;s<strong> uncommon</strong> to find someone with <em>brains</em> who also believes in the story of Noah&#039;s <em>Ark</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 7-12-2007(13): Think of common sense. To have the BRAINS to build an ARK would take<strong> UNCOMMON</strong> sense, cause everyone but Noah thought he was lacking in the BRAIN department.

It become so ridiculous that they both cut out their brains and place them TOGETHER side by side to see. Their opinions DIFFER and despite having the BRAINS right there, they DISAGREE.
