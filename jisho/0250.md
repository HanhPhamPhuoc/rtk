heisig: The idea of something getting <b>jammed into</b> something else is depicted here by having a <i>walking stick</i> get <b>jammed into</b> an <i>umbrella</i> frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the <i>umbrella</i> stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight <i>walking stick</i>. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant.
