## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 17-5-2007(257): You put your ear next to a womans crotch...and somehow, from it, you hear the words &quot;Take me....&quot;. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 1-5-2009(136): Fuaburisu&#039;s with a twist: You know that classic trick where someone pretends to<strong> take</strong> something out of an someone else&#039;s <em>ear</em> (such as a coin). Instead of a cigarette or a pen he pulls the person’s <em>crotch</em> out of their ear. Very painful! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-1-2006(46): Someone does the classic magic trick of pretending to<strong> take</strong> something out of their ear (such as a coin). Or maybe it is a cigarette or a pen that you<strong> take</strong> from behind the ear (the crotch of the ear). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skays">skays</a>] 3-6-2008(42): You know that episode of Family Guy where Meg was gonna<strong> take</strong> it in the <em>ear</em> instead of the <em>crotch</em>? 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Seiska">Seiska</a>] 7-11-2010(18): &quot;Its too dangerous to go alone<strong> take</strong> these.&quot; and so Link<strong> take</strong>s <em>earplugs</em> and <em>crotch</em> protection and goes to face the furious Zelda. Ganondorf was not the final boss.. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tofuinoakland">tofuinoakland</a>] 15-7-2008(18): <strong>Take</strong> your <em>ear</em> off my <em>crotch</em>! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 18-6-2008(18): If a girl will<strong> take</strong> sweet nothings in her <em>ear</em> she&#039;ll<strong> take</strong> big somethings in her <em>crotch</em>. (Note bottom horizontal stroke of ear is shortened). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SketchySolid">SketchySolid</a>] 2-12-2012(16): After defeating a foe in battle, the most common trophies to <strong>take</strong> are the <em>ear</em> and the <em>crotch</em>. (I find this helps to prevent confusion with &quot;accept&quot;, because no one will offer these things to you; you must<strong> take</strong> them). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sadfish">sadfish</a>] 29-5-2009(15): A doctor has an unusual method of <strong>taking</strong> your temperature... 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint">Clint</a>] 22-10-2008(7): Janis Joplin singing &quot;<strong>Take</strong> it!<strong> Take</strong> another little <em>ear</em> from my <em>crotch</em> now baby...&quot;.
