3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-1-2006(46): Someone does the classic magic trick of pretending to<strong> take</strong> something out of their ear (such as a coin). Or maybe it is a cigarette or a pen that you<strong> take</strong> from behind the ear (the crotch of the ear).
