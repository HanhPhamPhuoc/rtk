## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-3-2007(206): A<strong> headland</strong> is a <em>mountain</em> that is firmly <em>rooted</em> despite being surrounded on 3 sides by water. (Just like your head is a mountain surrounded by air on 3 sides, a<strong> headland</strong>!). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 21-4-2008(125): <strong>Headland</strong>s are natural forts; in fact, once men build castles on them, they become <em>armoured mountains</em>. (Gibralter, for example, is basically an <em>armoured mountain</em>). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 10-11-2008(26): A <em>mountain</em> that has been <em>pushed</em> into the sea. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 7-1-2011(22): The<strong> headland</strong> is <em>mountain</em>ous terrain that provides a natural fortification (or <em>armour</em>) against sea-borne invasion.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/岬">岬</a>   (みさき) : cape (on coast). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 9-1-2007(19): Forget confusing the meanings (<strong>headland</strong>, <a href="../778">promontory</a> <span class="index">(#778 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/崎">崎</a>)</span>, <a href="../153">cape</a> <span class="index">(#153 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/埼">埼</a>)</span>) they are synonyms, no way around that. Luckily, all three seem to be used in names most. I used: The<strong> headland</strong> or <strong>head</strong> of the <strong>land</strong> is obviously the part of the land that is placed highest, in the same way our head is highest on the body. <em>Mountains</em> are the <strong>head</strong>s of the <strong>land</strong>s they have planted their <em>roots</em> into. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Earthlark">Earthlark</a>] 16-8-2010(12): Just imagine Laputa, a <em>mountain</em><strong> headland</strong> floating over the sea with <em>roots</em> hanging off the bottom: <a href="http://www.tautoz.com/anime/gallery/ghibli/laputa/ruined-laputa.jpg">http://www.tautoz.com/anime/gallery/ghibli/laputa/ruined-laputa.jpg</a>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zz_alex_zz">zz_alex_zz</a>] 19-12-2007(11): Think of Mauna Kea - although this mountain seems like a <strong>headland</strong> when compared with Everest, if you measure Mauna Kea from the <em>root</em> of the mountain below sea level, it&#039;s a whopping 33,000ft in total! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea</a>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 27-3-2009(9): Ever see &quot;Welcome to the NHK&quot;? SPOILER: I have, I&#039;ll never forget this kanji.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/岬ちゃん">岬ちゃん</a>   （Misaki-chan) was named after a cliff (specifically, a<strong> headland</strong>) near her old house. When she was younger, there was a moment where her abused mother went off the cliff in front of her. Whether it was on purpose or accident is never known, but it&#039;s that little piece of <strong>land</strong> that causes her to be messed up in the <strong>head</strong>, that<strong> headland</strong> made the plot possible! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 22-10-2007(7): When a <strong>headland</strong> consists of a <em>mountain</em> you can be sure its <em>roots</em> go very deep. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 21-5-2013(4): A<strong> headland</strong> is a natural elevation (especially a rocky one that juts out in to the sea). The fact that is likely to be rocky will hopefully lead to the primitives as a<strong> headland</strong>, being rocky, clearly has a <em>mountain</em> in it&#039;s <em>roots</em>. Be aware it&#039;s a synonym with both <a href="../153">cape</a> <span class="index">(#153 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/埼">埼</a>)</span> and <a href="../778">promontory</a> <span class="index">(#778 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/崎">崎</a>)</span>.
