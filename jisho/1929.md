## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dragg">Dragg</a>] 22-3-2008(236): George W. Bush&#039;s plans for<strong> war</strong> were so SIMPLE. To him, its all just a big FIESTA.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 19-1-2009(71): What started out as a <em>simple fiesta</em>, turned into a full-scale<strong> war</strong> after arguments about whose potato salad was the best.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 9-10-2005(38): So there&#039;s this fiesta in downtown Compton. It&#039;s a simple party, but someone invited people from the wrong gangs and the simple fiesta turns into an all-out turf<strong> war</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-1-2006(27): <em>Simple-minded blond girl</em> (see previous frame) is going to a <em>fiesta</em>, and boy... is this<strong> war</strong> ! She may be simple-minded but she could easily have written The Art of<strong> War</strong>. Only, the woman&#039;s version. She has just arrived at the fiesta, she has quickly apprehended the battlefield, taking note of the other competing girls who may pose a threat, and where the good looking guys are. Just watch her dividing the girls, and conquering the boys. I told you, this is<strong> war</strong> !

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 27-6-2012(14): Think Iraq<strong> war</strong> - Rumsfeld thought it would be <em>simple</em>, but it was no <em>fiesta</em>. セン 戦争 せんそう.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 30-12-2007(9): Think of how World<strong> WAR</strong> One began: You had a SIMPLE parade (or FIESTA in this case) that broke out in<strong> WAR</strong> when the Archduke Fendinand was assasinated. Or you can go with<strong> WAR</strong> is SIMPLY a FIESTA that gets out of hand. Not very visual though.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 9-7-2008(7): The <em>simple</em>-minded fellow thought that the<strong> war</strong> was in fact a <em>fiesta</em> thrown for him for his b-day. Imagine the guy running out in the middle of the battlefield with a cone hat and one of those blowy things in his mouth.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 12-12-2008(6): For Hemingway<strong> war</strong> was a <em>Simple</em> <em>Fiesta</em> just like Paris was a A Moveable Feast.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drkdve">drkdve</a>] 28-4-2010(5): If your strategy in<strong> WAR</strong> is too SIMPLE, it will become a FIESTA of slaughter, with you as the piñata.
