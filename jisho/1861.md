## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 10-6-2007(186): The<strong> empress</strong> is cruel. Normally she&#039;ll violently pull her servants by the ear when they&#039;ve failed to follow orders. But <em>one time</em> she <em>dragged</em> this one guy around the palace by the <em>mouth</em>. She must have been really angry—ever since that moment, he&#039;s never been seen again.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(110): The <em>F</em> word often comes out of the <em>mouth</em> of the<strong> empress</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 1-10-2007(61): This is <em>ax</em> with the last stroke replaced by a <em>mouth</em>, thus forming a pictograph of someone about to have his <em>mouth</em> chopped off for spreading rumors about the<strong> empress</strong>. &quot;Off with his <em>mouth</em>!&quot; [Thanks raulir!].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 5-8-2009(23): The<strong> empress</strong> can have you <em>dragged</em> out of the room with just <em>one</em> word from her <em>mouth</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 18-12-2008(22): We know the<strong> empress</strong> is really a <em>drag queen</em> because she only has <em>one mouth</em> Think about it….

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Praxix">Praxix</a>] 10-2-2010(9): So that&#039;s the<strong> empress</strong>? Looks a lot like the director in drag.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 19-1-2009(5): She might be the<strong> empress</strong>, but as far as the emperor is concerned, she&#039;s just the old <em>battleaxe</em> with the big <em>mouth</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 8-3-2013(4): I told the<strong> empress</strong> she was a drag. She replied &quot;Shut your <em>F-ing mouth</em>!... 皇后陛下 こうごうへいか (Her Highness the<strong> Empress</strong>).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 12-3-2012(4): Tell the<strong> empress</strong> to fcuk off and leave me alone. (F.O. as written on the kanji).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 4-12-2010(4): 后妃 , 午后 , 皇后陛下 <a href="../1861">empress</a> (#1861 后) コウ, ゴ, きさき ... Parts: ⺁, 一 , 口 (cf 垢 <a href="../2187">blemish</a> (#2187 垢)) ... Note: RTK 姫 <a href="../849">princess</a> (#849 姫) should be thought of in terms of endearment (&quot;daddy&#039;s little princess&quot;). RTK 妃 <a href="../527">queen</a> (#527 妃) is direct relation to the Emperor, including princesses. RTK 后 <a href="../1861">empress</a> (#1861 后) is the actual<strong> empress</strong> ... Story: &quot;Fuck off&quot;, screamed the<strong> empress</strong>.
