heisig: "Under the familiar <i>top hat</i> we see a crisscross pattern or design, like that found on woodwork or garments. This should make an ugly enough image to help remember it. It can be associated with <b>sentence</b> by thinking of a <b>sentence</b> as a grammatical pattern. The primitive meaning for this character will be plaid, the familiar crisscross pattern frequently used in textiles."

## Heisig story:

Under the familiar <i>top hat</i> we see a crisscross pattern or design, like that found on woodwork or garments. This should make an ugly enough image to help remember it. It can be associated with <b>sentence</b> by thinking of a <b>sentence</b> as a grammatical pattern.

The primitive meaning for this character will be plaid, the familiar crisscross pattern frequently used in textiles.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 4-1-2007(183): A twist on greenapple: The teacher puts a tophat on all pupils with gramatically correct<strong> sentence</strong>s, while the rest are left with a big red X on their homework.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 2-5-2006(60): The teacher in the tophat puts an X on all the grammatically incorrect<strong> sentence</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 31-3-2008(34): I celebrated finishing the Heisig books by buying myself a <em>plaid top hat</em> (<em>top hat</em> with <em>criss cross</em> pattern to symbolize the crisscrossing flashcards) and then I began the AJATT<strong> sentence</strong> method.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 26-10-2007(14): It should not be a problem to see this as<strong> SENTENCE</strong>. For the primitive, think in a Scottish accent and say &quot;PLAID kilt&quot;. Guess it can look like a Beret wearing scot.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 28-7-2010(10): I&#039;m making <strong>sentence/plaid</strong> into a new primitive: <strong>Catholic schoolgirl</strong>. (This should be fun.) // All of the Catholic schoolgirls wear uniforms with <em>top hats</em> and <em>plaid</em> skirts, and sit in school practicing their<strong> sentence</strong>s.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-3-2007(5): Primitive: anything <em>SCOTTISH</em>: kilt, Braveheart, bagpipes, Highlander, plaid, etc.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 30-8-2011(4): 文化 , 文法 , 文章 , 文明 , 文部 , <a href="../v4/1725">sentence</a> (#1725 文) ブン, モン, ふみ ... Cf: 文 , 夂, 攵, 又 ... Similars: 句 <a href="../v4/65">phrase</a> (#65 句), 名詞 <a href="../v4/1865">parts of speech</a> (#1865 詞), 文 <a href="../v4/1725">sentence</a> (#1725 文) ... Note: On Japanese maps, this Kanji indicates a school (usually elementary, or middle school). A Better keyword would be <strong>Written Culture</strong>. If you think of it that way, then you can see this as a picttorial representation of a <em>Balanced Man of Letters</em>. Not a lecuturer, or a taskmaster, but a balanced man of letters.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 30-6-2009(3): Heres a weird<strong> sentence</strong> for you &quot;the mans top hat covered his crotch&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PositronLaser">PositronLaser</a>] 8-11-2009(2): Grammar police.... (if you hang out enough in the forums, you probably know what this means).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mary_K">Mary_K</a>] 5-6-2009(2): A <em>top hat</em> for those who get their<strong> sentence</strong>s right. A <em>X</em> for those who get their<strong> sentence</strong>s wrong. The <em>top hat</em> is preferred above the <em>X</em>.
