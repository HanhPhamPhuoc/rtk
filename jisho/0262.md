heisig: "The trick to remembering this character lies in associating the key word with the line from the nursery rhyme about 4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie: &quot;Wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the <i>king</i>?&quot; If we think of <b>display</b> in terms of that famous line, and the <i>king</i> with his head thrown back and his <i>mouth</i> wide open as 4 and 20 blackbirds fly in one after the other, we shall have satisfied both the elements and their position."
