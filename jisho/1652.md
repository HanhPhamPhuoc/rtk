## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 7-3-2007(231): <strong>Flats</strong> in the city are crowded. You get a space for your <em>car</em> in front, and a <em>clothesline</em> out back. Nothing else.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 11-7-2007(58): Small <strong>flats</strong> (garages) for <em>cars</em> help keeping them <em>dry</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matsuyamakiwi">matsuyamakiwi</a>] 29-6-2008(38): Did you hear about the guy obsessed with his <em>car</em>? He keeps it in his <strong>flat</strong> to keep <em>dry</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 27-2-2008(17): A flat/house definition: &#039;The thing that is between the car (in front) and the clothesline (in back) .

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 20-6-2010(8): I don&#039;t have a garage, so I keep my <em>car</em> in my <strong>flat</strong> to keep it <em>dry</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 22-9-2008(6): The problem with living in a block of<strong> flats</strong> is there isn&#039;t anywhere to keep your <em>car</em> and usually no room for a <em>clothesline</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 4-3-2012(5): <strong>Flats</strong> in the city are crowded. You get a space for your <em>car</em> in front, and a <em>clothesline</em> out back. Nothing else. REMEMBER THE POSITION: Parking spaces for the car are always in front of the house. THIS KANJI is used to count houses: 一軒 【いっけん】 one house.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 25-10-2007(5): In the vampire cities, the<strong> flats</strong> are about the size of a car. All they need room for is a coffin. Mnemonic: <em>Car</em> sized<strong> flats</strong> for <em>vampire</em>s.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-1-2006(5): I imagine &quot;flats&quot; literally as flat appartments. You can tell someone&#039;s living in a flat when you see their &quot;dry&quot; car. The car rarely gets any shadow since it&#039;s parked near &quot;flat&quot;<strong> flats</strong>, thus it gets a constant exposure to the elements, especially the sun, and the paint is all crackled and &quot;dry&quot; looking...

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vengeorgeb">vengeorgeb</a>] 4-5-2009(4): [flats, eave]. Imagine this guy drunk waking up the next day in the morning in his backyard wrapped by the <em>clotheline</em> and the <em>car</em> hanging from the<strong> flats</strong> (eaves) of the roof.
