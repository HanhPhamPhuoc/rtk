## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 10-5-2007(448): When I am in a<strong> LAZY</strong> <em>state of mind</em> I use my <em>left</em> hand to play with my <em>meat</em>...it feels like someone else is doing it, which is good cause I&#039;m to<strong> lazy</strong> to get a date.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iheckman">iheckman</a>] 27-5-2008(174): When in a<strong> lazy</strong> state of mind, the things you need to do are left for next month.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 24-10-2005(66): This may only work for me, but I just think that the left side of my body is the<strong> lazy</strong> side. It sometimes takes over and puts my whole body in a<strong> lazy</strong> state of mind.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-8-2007(61): <em>Data</em> was just being <strong>lazy</strong> when he claimed the <em>left</em> side of his <em>body</em> had malfunctioned and he couldn&#039;t help.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dizzwave">dizzwave</a>] 15-7-2008(40): Picard notices that the Enterprise is off course, and shouts, &quot;<em>Data</em>! I told you to turn <em>left</em> at the <em>moon</em>! What happened?&quot; Data replies, with his characteristic eyebrow-raise, &quot;I don&#039;t know, sir. I just didn&#039;t feel like doing it. Is that what humans call....<strong> lazy</strong>?&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 20-6-2006(30): (Building upon darg_sama and raulir) Anyone could be ambidextrous, and work with both hands... but the general <em>state of mind</em> of people (&quot;right-handed&quot;) leaves the <em>left</em> side of the <em>body</em> <strong>lazy</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Udunno13">Udunno13</a>] 3-3-2009(12): When I&#039;m feeling<strong> lazy</strong>, I&#039;m in a <em>state of mind</em> where my <em>body</em> just wants to be <em>left</em> alone.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 16-10-2007(7): When Data is feeling<strong> lazy</strong> he uses his <em>left</em> hand to play with his meat...it feels like someone else is doing it, which is good cause he&#039;s to<strong> lazy</strong> to get a date. (thanks johnzep).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 1-6-2010(5): <strong>Laziness</strong> is a <em>state of mind</em> epitomised by the <em>left</em> <em>parts of my body</em>. My left hand does not move the pen; my left thumb does not strike the space bar; when driving, my left foot does not press down the gas pedal and apply the brakes. (If only I didn&#039;t kick with my left foot, this story would be complete).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/awaken">awaken</a>] 12-7-2012(4): When I&#039;m in a <strong>lazy</strong> <em>state of mind</em> I don&#039;t use the <em>left</em> side of my brain for a whole <em>month</em>.
