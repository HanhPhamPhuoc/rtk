## Reading:

### On-Yomi:  &mdash; Kun-Yomi: とち

## Heisig story:

A tree . . . cliff . . . ten thousand.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 6-9-2006(276): There are a bunch of<strong> HORSE CHESTNUT</strong> TREES on top of this CLIFF above the beach. Chestnuts keep rolling off the cliff and falling on people&#039;s heads. So far TEN THOUSAND people have been killed by falling chestnuts, and the Japanese government still ain&#039;t did shit about it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 26-1-2008(72): There is a<strong> horse chestnut</strong> <em>tree</em> that has grown by a <em>cliff</em> for so long, it has deposited <em>10,000</em> <strong>horse chesnut</strong>s that lie at the bottom. Don&#039;t worry over this one too much, you&#039;ll spend so much time trying to figure out the right story for it, you probably won&#039;t forget it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 9-7-2008(38): <strong>Horse chestnut</strong> trees grows in tens of thousands under the cliff.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 29-3-2010(28): Strokes 5 and 6 are in reverse order, so it&#039;s not an ordinary cliff, but a <em>drag</em> (primitive at the beginning of lesson 50!) Story: When we were kids, we loved collecting the fruits of the <strong>horse chestnut</strong> <em>tree</em>. But because there were so many to collect, we sometimes <em>dragged</em> more than <em>ten thousand</em> of them behind us!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 7-12-2008(28): This is NOT a cliff. the first stroke is right to left and slanted a bit. in fact, it&#039;s more like the axe blade of the axe character. story: you didn&#039;t want to try to chop down the<strong> horse chestnut</strong> tree with an axe because the chestnut kept falling on you. so instead you just stacked up <em>10,000</em> <em>axe-blades</em> next to the tree, and eventually they the stack fell on the tree and sliced it to pieces.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 3-11-2010(17): 栃木県 <a href="../v4/514">horse chestnut</a> (#514 栃) とち ... Parts: 木 , Drag (1852.9), 万 (cf 励む <a href="../v4/866">encourage</a> (#866 励), 砺 <a href="../v4/2595">whetstone</a> (#2595 砺)) ... Note: Heisig got this wrong, It&#039;s not 厂; it&#039;s <em>Drag</em>. Japanese (Non-Residents of Tochigi Prefecture) don&#039;t know how to write this one either, though. But 励 , which shares a primitive is written with 厂, not drag. Japanese sucks. ... Story: &quot;Is Tochigi Prefecture (horse chestnut) written with cliff?&quot; &quot;<em>No, no, Man</em> ノ, ノ, 万 .&quot; &quot;So how do I remember it?&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(12): I can&#039;t open this d*mn<strong> HORSE CHESTNUT</strong>. I beat it 10,000 times with a TREE. It didn&#039;t work! I got so pissed I just threw it off a cliff.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 3-1-2013(9): <strong>STROKE ORDER</strong>: The top stroke of <em>cliff</em> is curiously slanted, it&#039;s because that stroke starts from the upper right. This isn&#039;t the usual <em>cliff</em> primitive.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 27-3-2009(9): &quot;Is it an ordinary <em>TREE</em>? There under the cliff&quot;,- I asked Tochi-kun (とち). &quot;<em>NO, NO, MAN</em> ( <a href="http://google.com/#q=ノ、ノ、「万」">ノ、ノ、「万」</a> )! That&#039;s a<strong> horse chestnut</strong> tree, and there is no cliff there. There are just a ten thousand chestnuts forming a big pile, that you mistook for the cliff&quot;, - Tochi answered. Note: when writing the right half of the character remember to start from the right upper point and write the &quot;noｎ-cliff&quot; element in two strokes, each resembling the katakana (no) ノ.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 29-10-2009(5): The<strong> horse chestnut</strong> <em>tree</em> grows on a steep <em>cliff</em>, <em>10,000</em> feet high.
