heisig: "<i>Street</i> signs standing at the corner of the <i>rice fields</i> depict the <b>village</b> limits. (Remember what was said earlier: when used as a primitive, a kanji may either take its primitive meaning or revert to the original meaning of its key word.)"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 19-11-2006(150): Actually this means <strong>town</strong>, like one that has lots of <em>streets</em> and is surrounded by all the <em>rice fields</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 20-8-2008(84): Getting this one confused with Town is easy, so remember it with this rhyme. &quot;Pillage the<strong> village</strong>, for the <em>rice</em> and and the <em>tea</em>.&quot; the street primitive on the right looks like a &#039;t&#039;. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 25-8-2007(63): Note: the keywords of <a href="../92">village</a> <span class="index">(#92 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/町">町</a>)</span> and <a href="../208">town</a> <span class="index">(#208 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/村">村</a>)</span> swap places in translated editions of RTK I. In fact, according to different dictionaries,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/町">町</a>   is closer to &#039;town&#039; whereas   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/村">村</a>   is closer to &#039;village&#039;. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 1-7-2008(20): <em>Streets</em> through <em>rice fields</em> are only found in small <strong>villages</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 29-3-2008(13): チョウ　まち　　A<strong> village</strong>/TOWN is nothing more than rice fields connected by streets. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kuroneko">kuroneko</a>] 16-3-2008(12): I too switch <a href="../208">town</a> <span class="index">(#208 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/村">村</a>)</span> and <strong>village</strong>. Although Heisig states never to change the key-word, this is one of the exceptions for me because they are wrong by definition. A <em>town</em> is much bigger than a <em>village</em>, just as a   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/町">町</a>   is much bigger than a   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/村">村</a>  . I remember   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/町">町</a>   as the more developed because the <em>tree</em> was cut down to make a <em>rice field</em> so Heisig&#039;s key-words do nothing but confuse the hell out of me. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogen2">dogen2</a>] 17-3-2007(10): In M. Night Shyamalan&#039;s The <strong>Village</strong>, Joaquin Phoenix passes through the <em>field</em> into the forest, and discovers a modern <em>street</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 16-5-2009(8): Field of streets=<strong> village</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 27-8-2007(6): Oomachi is such a tiny<strong> village</strong> that they just have a sign <strong>nailed</strong> to the corner of the main rice field. &quot;Welcome to our<strong> Village</strong>&quot;. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fabiomandrioli">fabiomandrioli</a>] 9-2-2009(4): MUNICIPALITY as 2008:   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/県">県</a>   : けん (ken) = <a href="../513">prefecture</a> <span class="index">(#513 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/県">県</a>)</span>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/郡">郡</a>   : ぐん (gun) = <em>district</em> or <a href="../1843">county</a> <span class="index">(#1843 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/郡">郡</a>)</span>. Those rural units are subdivided in   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/町">町</a>   and   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/村">村</a>   with no uncovered area and no overlapping.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/市">市</a>   : し (shi) = <em>city</em>. Local administrative unit, not component of   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/郡">郡</a>  .　　　　　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/町">町</a>   : ちょう (choo) o まち (machi) = <strong>town</strong>. Bigger than a <em>village</em>, but less than 50000 pp.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/村">村</a>   : そん (son) o むら (mura) = <em>village</em> (FRAME 208). Considerably smaller than a   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/町">町</a>  , more close to a large settlement.
