2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 28-8-2006(90): <strong>Laying waste</strong> is just a euphamism for flushing poop down the toilet. It smells nothing like <em>flowers</em>, more like <em>deceased flowers</em>, and it&#039;s flushed down into a <em>stream</em> of sewage. Use &quot;waste&quot; to avoid <a href="../365">destroy</a> (#365 滅) <a href="../400">demolition</a> (#400 壊).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 29-10-2007(26): Hurricane Katrina<strong> laid waste</strong> to New Orleans....as a result, a <em>stream</em> of <em>dead flowers</em> floated into the sea.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 11-10-2010(6): The army that<strong> laid waste</strong> the entire region left nothing but <em>flowers</em> marking where thousands <em>perish</em>ed and blood flowed in <em>streams</em>. 荒い あらい rough, rude, wild; 荒っぽい (あらっぽい) : rough, rude; 荒廃 (こうはい) : ruin; 荒らす (あらす) : to lay waste, to devastate, to damage, to invade, to break into; 荒れる (あれる) : be stormy, lose one&#039;s temper.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 23-1-2010(4): For me, this is a pictograph of the giant octopus of death. This killer octopus is female and likes to look good and decorate her head with flowers. Like one of the giant beasts in a Godzilla movie, the killer octopus<strong> laid waste</strong> to town after town raiding the florists for more and more hair accessories. Go ahead. Picture it.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 22-3-2009(4): This is the spitting image of a dramatic movie shot after a town has been<strong> laid waste</strong>. After the carnage, the scene switches to a shot of <em>rose</em> pedals floating down a <em>stream</em>--the red color reminding us of all the <em>death</em> we just saw.
