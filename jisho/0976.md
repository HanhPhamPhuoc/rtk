## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 23-8-2007(139): <em>Mr. T</em> infiltrates the secret samurai <em>Buddhist temple</em> as a <strong>waiter</strong> with a tray of green tea. (Careful: <a href="../960">attend</a> <span class="index">(#960 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/仕">仕</a>)</span>). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelooseteeth">thelooseteeth</a>] 1-3-2009(115): Remember the kanji for <strong>wait</strong>,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/待">待</a>  . Well, now we have a <strong>waiter</strong>, and he&#039;s dropped a dish. See:   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/侍">侍</a>  !   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/待">待</a>   <em>crash</em>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/侍">侍</a>  . 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 25-10-2005(41): <em>Mister T</em> can do no meditation! So he is a<strong> waiter</strong> at the <em>Buddhist temple</em>, attending upon the zen monks, serving green tea, etc. (but mostly, he is annoying all the monks with the noise of his big gold chains). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 19-12-2008(19): I think its best if we derive this from   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/待">待</a>   (wait). So the<strong> waiter</strong>, WAITS for the people to pick their order by holding the menu [extra stroke] in his hand. This clever keyword allows one to go from<strong> waiter</strong> -&gt; person that SERVES you. A samurai was bound by oath to SERVE their master etc etc,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/侍女">侍女</a>   【じじょ】 (n) lady attendant, maid, (P)   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/侍医">侍医</a>   【じい】 (n) court physician, (P). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 8-12-2006(10): The A-team tries to disguise <strong>Mr. T</strong> as a <em>waiter</em>. It would have worked too, except that he was to go undercover at a <strong>Buddhist temple</strong>. &quot;I pity da foo sent me to a <strong>Buddhist temple</strong> dressed up like a <em>waiter</em>!&quot;. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 16-7-2009(8): <em>Mr. T</em> sits in the <em>temple</em> and says, &quot;They took the kanji for <strong>SAMURAI</strong> and called it &#039;waiter&#039;?! Forget this Heisig jibba jabba. I pity that poor fool!&quot;. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 1-9-2008(8): <em>Haruhi</em> visits a <em>temple</em> and asks where the<strong> waiter</strong> is to serve her.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drkdve">drkdve</a>] 7-3-2010(4): If   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/待">待</a>   (wait) is a column of people waiting to enter a <em>Buddhist Temple</em> one solitary <em>person</em> instead of a line of them is still a<strong> waiter</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 3-1-2010(4): After Michael fires <em>Dwight Schrute</em>, Dwight gets a job as a<strong> waiter</strong> at <em>The Buddhist Temple</em>, an upscale vegan restaurant. Picture Dwight trying to talk people into eating meat.
