heisig: <i>Go in</i> . . . <i>an umbrella</i> . . . <i>a mouth</i>. Because of space restrictions, the element for <i>go in</i> is shortened in this character. If you stand on your head and look at this kanji, the image of a <b>valley</b> stands out more clearly: the <i>mouth</i> of the river whose water flows down at the intersection of the two mountains, with the final two strokes adding the element of perspective. Now get back on your feet again and see if the image still remains clear. If not, then return to the primitives and make a story in the usual way.
