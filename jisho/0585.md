## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas">amthomas</a>] 10-1-2007(147): A nice picnic <em>pent up</em> in the<strong> park</strong>, with your <em>crock pot</em> and <em>scarf</em> (picnic blanket). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-6-2006(48): You&#039;re walking in the<strong> park</strong> and a little ways off the path there is a “pent in” lidded crock on a scarf. Just picture it and it should work. You may also imagine the lidded crock family is having a picnic in the<strong> park</strong>, and &#039;baby lidded crock&#039; was left alone in its pen/playpen, wearing a scarf (or sleeping on a scarf). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zodiac">zodiac</a>] 5-11-2008(41): In the<strong> park</strong>, I discovered a <em>lidded crock wrapped with a scarf</em>. The police promptly <em>pent</em> it up. (lidded crock wrapped in scarf = fake bomb, look at first story in <a href="../402">distant</a> <span class="index">(#402 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/遠">遠</a>)</span>). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg">sethg</a>] 3-3-2009(21): This is just like the <em>lidded crock</em> wrapped in a <em>scarf</em> you had to stay <a href="../402">distant</a> <span class="index">(#402 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/遠">遠</a>)</span> from. This time it&#039;s even more dangerous, because it&#039;s <em>pent in</em> the sandbox in the<strong> park</strong>, where children play. Who knows what could be inside! Hopefully it&#039;s something as harmless as a <a href="../403">monkey</a> <span class="index">(#403 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/猿">猿</a>)</span> this time. Who would put something so potentially dangerous in a<strong> park</strong>, anyway? 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koiulpoi">koiulpoi</a>] 28-6-2009(12): When wearing a nice <em>long kimono</em>, the best thing to do is to go visit the<strong> park</strong> (which is obviously hedged in), and show off your stuff. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 29-3-2008(9): I see the lidded crock guy from <a href="../402">distant</a> <span class="index">(#402 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/遠">遠</a>)</span>, as many others seem to. But, he&#039;s not on the road any more. He&#039;s <em>pent up</em> in jail, which is exactly where he belongs after trying to molest someone in the<strong> park</strong>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Fadeway">Fadeway</a>] 11-3-2012(7): Imagine a beautiful<strong> park</strong>, <em>pent in</em> of course, with women in <em>long kimonos</em> walking between the blossoming cherry trees. Beautiful! (Notice how the <em>long kimono</em> changes when there is a line under it, compare <a href="../402">distant</a> <span class="index">(#402 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/遠">遠</a>)</span>, contrast <a href="../403">monkey</a> <span class="index">(#403 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/猿">猿</a>)</span>). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SketchySolid">SketchySolid</a>] 28-8-2009(6): Imagine a rather odd family going on a picnic. When they get to the <strong>park</strong>, they set up a fence around an area (<em>penning</em> themselves <em>in</em>), lay out a really long <em>scarf</em>, and haul out their <em>lidded crock</em> full of food. How strange. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 13-4-2008(6): <strong>PARK</strong> makes me remember Cheery-blossom-viewing parties. I took a <em>lidded crock</em> full of freshly-cooked muffins, wrapped in a <em>scarf</em> to keep them warm. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 3-10-2012(4): Remember FRAME 402   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/遠">遠</a>   DISTANT? (Keep distant from a <em>lidded crock</em> on the<em> road</em> wrapped in a PAPER BAG. It might be a bomb.) Here, we hide in the<strong> PARK</strong> to be safe from the bomb. I rename this incomplete scarf as PAPER BAG, and it shows up 4 times   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/遠">遠</a>   <a href="../402">distant</a> <span class="index">(#402 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/遠">遠</a>)</span>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/園">園</a>   <a href="../585">park</a> <span class="index">(#585 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/園">園</a>)</span>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/環">環</a>   <a href="../836">ring</a> <span class="index">(#836 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/環">環</a>)</span>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/還">還</a>   <a href="../837">send back</a> <span class="index">(#837 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/還">還</a>)</span>.
