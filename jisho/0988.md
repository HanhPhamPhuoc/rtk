## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 11-5-2008(136): Mr. T shows his<strong> humanity</strong> by giving <em>two</em> bucks to every homeless person he sees. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 21-12-2007(90): <strong>Warning</strong>: This is not<strong> humanity</strong> as in all the people. But rather the qualities that make us human such as compassion and benevolence. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 9-7-2008(51): This character, as Heisig points out, is strongly Confucian. Some scholars say that it references the importance of <strong>humane</strong> relationships between <em>two people</em> (parent/child, sibling/sibling, ruler/subject, etc). It&#039;s easy enough, though, to look at it as a person in a dialogue with another - the give and take, yin and yang - the <em>two</em>-way street in which<strong> humanity</strong> relates to each other. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 15-2-2006(22): <strong>Humanity</strong> began with <em>two people</em>, adam and eve. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrenaline">adrenaline</a>] 18-5-2009(15): <strong>Humanity</strong> needs only two things: CHUCK and NORRIS. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 18-2-2009(12): <em>Mr. T</em> has <em>Twice</em> the<strong> humanity</strong> as normal people. --- &quot;Why you think I care so much foo&#039;!?&quot;. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 10-11-2006(11): OK, this one&#039;s a little silly, but it&#039;s worked so well for me that I&#039;m going to share it... &quot;Oh, the<strong> HUMANITY</strong>! Oh the<strong> HUMANITY</strong>&quot;, MR. T says TWICE, contemplating<strong> HUMANITY</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 19-10-2008(9): <em>Chuck Norris</em> shows his<strong> humanity</strong> by counting up to <em>two</em> before beating the hell out of his opponent. ONE... TWO... you&#039;re dead ! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 27-12-2007(7): The <em>two</em> qualities that give <em>people</em> their<strong> humanity</strong> are compassion and generosity. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Verdana">Verdana</a>] 11-6-2009(6): <em>Khatzumoto</em> gives <em>two</em> thumbs up for the<strong> humanity</strong> and its ability to learn languages.
