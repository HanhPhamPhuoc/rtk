## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samueruht">samueruht</a>] 15-2-2008(215): A legend says that if you<strong> model</strong> a <em>mountain goat</em> (with tail and everything) from dirt and leave to the light of the moon on the <a href="../2846">first day of the month</a> (#2846 朔), the <em>dirt</em> will became <em>flesh</em>. (blackstockc).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 28-1-2008(74): If you<strong> model</strong> a mountain goat from &quot;soil&quot; and leave it under the full &quot;moon,&quot; it will come to life.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 15-6-2007(36): Think of a Chia Pet. One of the very first<strong> model</strong>s was a <em>mountain goat made entirely of soil</em>, but it wasn&#039;t stable at all. The soil would crack and dry up in sunlight, so the only way to give a soil-based Chia Pet some light was to leave it in the <em>soft glow of the full moon</em>. They were spectacular, but the clay<strong> model</strong>s soon proved to be easier to sell.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 22-11-2007(35): Tip: <em>mountain goat</em> and <em>moon</em> are later combined into <a href="../2846">first day of the month</a> (#2846 朔).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 26-12-2008(9): The <em>mountain goat</em>, who has the cow as its role<strong> model</strong>, also tried to jump over the <em>moon</em>. Unfortunately it couldn&#039;t even lift itself off the <em>ground</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 17-3-2008(8): I tried making a MOUNTAIN GOAT<strong> MODEL</strong> out of DIRT, but that did not work, so I just got a live one, killed it, and used its MEAT to make the<strong> MODEL</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(6): A <em>mountain goat</em> tried to<strong> model</strong> a sculpture of the <em>moon</em> using only the <em>dirt</em> below. Needless to say, with just hooves to use, it looked pretty baaaaaaaad...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 4-5-2011(3): On <em>the first day of the month</em> (<a href="../2846">first day of the month</a> (#2846 朔)) the tabloids released a lot of <em>dirt</em> about that super<strong>model</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhiteley">dwhiteley</a>] 30-10-2011(2): A<strong> model</strong> of a <em>mountain goat</em> on the <em>moon</em> made out of <em>soil</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 8-8-2009(2): The Chia pet is a<strong> model</strong> of the <em>mountain goat&#039;s body</em>, made out of <em>dirt</em>.
