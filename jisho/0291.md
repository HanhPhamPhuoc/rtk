## Heisig story:

&quot;Suum cuique&quot; goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her <i>mouth</i> between his/her <i>walking legs</i>, giving us an image of &quot;To <b>each</b> his/her own.&quot;

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penne">penne</a>] 16-3-2008(260): Son, I&#039;ve never told you this but<strong> each</strong> woman has a second <em>mouth</em> between their fiiiiiine <em>walking legs</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg">johanvg</a>] 18-7-2006(156): <strong>Each</strong> and every one of us walks and talks differently.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miki76">miki76</a>] 15-12-2008(87): <strong>Each</strong> person is gifted with a <em>mouth</em> to get us into trouble and a pair of <em>walking legs</em> to get us out!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 12-2-2007(67): It&#039;s easier for me to remember a concrete object. This combination occurs often enough for me to make it a primitive element. Walking legs and mouth combine to give a &quot;walky talky&quot; or mobile phone. Imagine one of those old big ones which looked like refridgerators. Mobile phones are so popular that<strong> each</strong> of us seems to want one.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 6-2-2008(39): <strong>EACH</strong> of us learns first to use our <em>legs to walk</em> and then to use our <em>mouths</em> to talk.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 10-4-2008(19): <strong>Each</strong> pair of legs has at least one hole between them.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 29-7-2007(19): It is easy to confuse this kanji with <a href="../458">every</a> (#458 毎) -- &#039;each&#039; and &#039;every&#039; generally mean the same thing in the English language, it&#039;s just their usage is different -- for example, you cannot use &#039;every&#039; to describe objects in a group of size less than 3. This kanji shows someone&#039;s <em>walking legs</em> at an open man-<em>hole</em>.<strong> Each</strong> leg wants to go its&#039; own way -- the left foot wants to go left, and the right foot wants to go right.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PATRICKRL">PATRICKRL</a>] 1-8-2010(16): WARNING: DO NOT use a &quot;woman has an extra mouth story&quot;, you may begin using &quot;woman&quot; instead of &quot;walking legs&quot; for the top element.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac">aphasiac</a>] 11-3-2010(7): Imagine a Head Park Ranger talking to his squad - &quot;I want<strong> EACH</strong> of you to take a <em>walkie talkie</em> and radio back to the base at regular intervals...now move it men!!&quot; (each is too vague, so I use <strong>walkie-talkie</strong> (walking legs + mouth) as a primitive from now on).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rhadryn">Rhadryn</a>] 6-3-2010(6): <strong>Each</strong> person should consider walking the walk a higher priority than talking the talk.
