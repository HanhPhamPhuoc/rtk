heisig: By now kanji like this one should "look like" something to you even though it is more of an "ideogram" than a "pictograph." The large <i>mouth</i> on top and the <i>human legs</i> below almost jump off the page as a caricature of <b>elder brother</b>, the one with the big <i>mouth</i> (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who "has the say" among all the children).
