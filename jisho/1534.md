## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 6-2-2008(147): &quot;Once in a<strong> blue</strong> <em>moon</em>&quot; refers to a rare event. But originally &quot;blue moon&quot; refers to a full moon, in other words a fully <em>grown-up</em> moon. Whether once a month is rare or not depends on what we&#039;re talking about, but that happens to be the origin of the expression.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 4-3-2007(104): The last time I saw a <strong>blue</strong> <em>moon</em> was in my <strong>youth</strong> when I was <em>growing up</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 19-6-2006(40): <strong>Blue</strong> = Smurfs, whose <em>bodies</em> never <em>grow up</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 17-5-2007(34): They say that as the sun gets older, it grows up and becomes red. However, that&#039;s not the case for the <em>moon</em>, which turns<strong> blue</strong> as it <em>grows up</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 26-3-2008(22): Once in a<strong> Blue</strong> <em>moon</em> you can see <em>Peter Pan</em> flying high above it.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 30-3-2008(20): The next six kanjis with<strong> blue</strong> as a component all include セイ as a reading.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 9-2-2007(19): When Asian babies are born they often have a<strong> blue</strong> spot on their <em>flesh</em> (around the base of the spine), but it changes to the normal skin color as they <em>grow up</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kodama">kodama</a>] 27-10-2007(11): Now she&#039;s <em>grown up</em>, <em>Alice</em> only visits Wonderland once in a<strong> blue</strong> <em>moon</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 23-3-2009(10): <strong>Note:</strong> Most years have twelve full moons which occur approximately monthly, but in addition to those twelve full lunar cycles each calendar year contains an excess of roughly eleven days. The extra days accumulate, so that every two or three years there is an extra full moon (this happens every 2.7 years). The extra moon is called a &quot;blue moon.&quot; (Wikipedia) <strong>Story:</strong> (It can help to imagine that this extra moon is literally<strong> blue</strong> and) occasionally a <em>moon</em> will <em>grow up</em> into a<strong> blue</strong> moon!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 7-6-2006(7): As you <em>grow up</em>, experience of<strong> blue</strong> <em>moons</em> becomes more common.
