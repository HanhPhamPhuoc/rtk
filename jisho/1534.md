## Koohii stories:

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 5-9-2011(9): 酉の方角 , 酉の市 <a href="../1427">sign of the bird</a> (#1427 酉) ユウ, とり, なが, みのる ... Pict <strong>Whiskey Bottle</strong> (cf: 西 <a href="../1602">west</a> (#1602 西), 丙 <a href="../1020">third class</a> (#1020 丙)) ... <a href="midori://search?text=部首＃">部首＃</a> 164, とりへん,Sake Radical ... Note2: (Drinky Crow) Any &#039;Sign of the &#039;Animal name&#039; Kanji will end up reading the same as a more familiar Kanji. Example: 酉年 =とりどし=Year of the Bird, uses this Kanji and not the usual 鳥 . Others: 午年 , 戌年 , 寅年 , 子年 , 未年 , 巳年 , 申年 , 卯年 , 丑年 , 亥年 .

People were worried about it and kept asking &quot;Is there any<strong> sign of the bird</strong> – you know, the <em>one</em> that flew <em>west</em>?&quot; Addendum: The bird flew west because he drank too much whiskey. (Original story by Katsuo).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 7-7-2009(4): There&#039;s this guy with really long <em>human legs</em> and a bottle of whiskey dangling from a helicopter above an area where a farmer has all his animals <em>pent-in</em>. The farmer says to the guy, &quot;...are you... perhaps... a<strong> sign of the bird</strong>?&quot; Just when the guy was about to ask what the hell he was talking about, the helicopter explodes, and goes plummeting into the grou- I mean <em>floor</em>. Everything is destroyed in a massive conflagration from shitland.
