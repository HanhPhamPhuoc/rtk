3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 29-5-2008(32): Instead of puppet I like to think of &quot;someone&quot; as ninja (since it is the second kanji in ninja).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wisego">wisego</a>] 6-7-2009(17): <em>Spidey</em> and a <em>Ninja</em> fight over a sexy<strong> thong</strong> they found, but then they realize that together (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/一緒">一緒</a>  ) they could easily get another... ショ　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/一緒">一緒</a>  　いっしょ(together)　　　チヨ　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/情緒">情緒</a>  　じょうちょ(heartstrings)….

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 22-5-2007(15): Why&#039;s there a <em>thread</em> up <em>Pinocchio&#039;s</em> ass? Oh, gross, he&#039;s wearing a<strong> thong</strong>! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo">ezmoreldo</a>] 14-4-2008(12): A thread is just the right size for a puppets<strong> thong</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 8-12-2008(11): Imagine walking in on <em>Spiderman</em> and <em>Chucky</em> dressed in <strong>thongs</strong>. Let&#039;s face it, a super-hero and a murderous doll - you aren&#039;t living to tell this tale. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 21-4-2010(5): NB This is also the しょ　in   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/一緒">一緒</a>  （いっしょ）, together. Story: SPIDERMAN and his LOVEDOLL wear<strong> THONG</strong>S together. His and hers matching set maybe? 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 6-12-2006(5): This &quot;thong&quot; character always brings   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/鼻緒">鼻緒</a>   to my mind, i.e. the sandal straps (oh well, let them be &quot;thongs&quot; then) that go from the sides of Japanese sandals to the &quot;nose&quot;. This poor(?) puppet broke his and replaced them with the threads that used to bind him to his master.
