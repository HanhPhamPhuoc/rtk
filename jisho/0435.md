## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 6-7-2006(254): The crazy<strong> sovereign</strong> stands up from his throne, wearing nothing but a crown and a towel. That&#039;s why they try to keep him locked up in the castle away from the public. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 16-2-2008(51): This one is so tricky for me. The key is to remember that the bottom stroke on the <em>standing</em> element takes those little crown &quot;winglets&quot; on the right and left. The most effective image might be of QEII (who is quite short) using her crown as a kind of stool. She&#039;s <em>standing</em> on her <em>crown</em> rummaging through a high cupboard looking for her <em>apron.</em> I guess the<strong> sovereign</strong>&#039;s servants have the day off. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 31-3-2007(34): Imaging queen Elizabeth...england&#039;s<strong> SOVEREIGN</strong> as she STANDS at the sink doing dishes wearing nothing but an APRON. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 21-7-2009(15): The<strong> sovereign</strong> likes to make his female servants <em>stand</em> around in nothing but <em>aprons</em>. Can&#039;t say I blame him. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wisher">Wisher</a>] 31-8-2008(12): The first thing you need to be a<strong> SOVEREIGN</strong>, is to STAND TALL above your people and inspire them with confidence. The second would be to wear a cool CROWN. Third and most important, please wear underwear or at least a TOWEL to cover up you privates. People are going to be &quot;looking up to you.&quot; (Inspired by WithLoveFromExIA&#039;s post).

Story: Think of Rome. Now picture a <strong>sovereign</strong> standing with a <em>crown</em> and a <em>hanging cloth</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 11-8-2009(9): I kept getting this one confused with other kanji, so I had to move away from a kingly image. Instead recall<strong> Sovereign</strong>, the Reaper from Mass Effect. You need to <em>stand up</em> to it, but for most of the game the council (the <em>crown</em>) seems like they have a <em>towel</em> over their eyes (you can see it covering their faces below the crown) since they won&#039;t believe your claims that it exists. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jadyarewar">jadyarewar</a>] 30-6-2010(7): The<strong> sovereign</strong> is so short he needs to stand up on his crown to reach the towels. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 13-4-2008(6): <em>Allegedly true story</em>: I knew some-one who had been working in a remote Scottish hotel visited by Prince Charles. He claimed that he went into the kitchen and was confronted by our future<strong> SOVEREIGN</strong> doing the washing up. I can imagine him, <em>standing</em> there at the sink in an <em>apron</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 30-9-2008(5): The<strong> sovereign</strong> of a little-known poor country wears a <em>bottomless vase</em> for a <em>crown</em> and a <em>towel</em> for a royal robe. (Note that the bottom stroke is missing from the &quot;stand up&quot; primitive).
