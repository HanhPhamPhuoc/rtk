## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 22-9-2006(24): Yep, it&#039;s a party alright. The <em>kazoo fiesta noise</em> is audible from far away, and look, they fashioned<strong> pennant</strong>s out of <em>towels</em> to use as a signal flag for beckoning visitors in.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(16): Many <em>towels</em> were waved and <em>kazoos</em> blown when the Cardinals won the<strong> pennant</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 7-7-2009(9): A<strong> pennant</strong> is a <em>cloth</em> flag that is blown so hard by the wind that it vibrates audibly, buzzing like a <em>kazoo</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 24-3-2008(3): Strips of <em>towel</em> were torn for makeshift <strong>pennants</strong> as the kindgergarteners marched around, trumpeting on their <em>kazoos</em>, in their school parade.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 19-3-2010(2): To celebrate the Cardinals victory in the<strong> pennant</strong>, Towelie takes a hit from his kazoo converted into a makeshift pipe.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kokage">kokage</a>] 15-2-2011(1): During the Soccer World Cup,<strong> pennant</strong>s were tied to cars, <em>towels</em> in the national colours were hung out of windows and <em>vuvuzelas</em> were blown. It was a good good summer.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 29-6-2010(1): A<strong> pennant</strong> is a <em>towel</em> that screams its team like a <em>kazoo</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 14-2-2010(1): When Federer won the<strong> pennant</strong>, he wiped his forehead with a <em>towel</em> while the crowd, obliged to remain silent for the duration of the match, roared and blew on <em>kazoos</em>. Kazoo is a funny word. 鯉幟 こいのぼり, carp streamer.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceupysee8">Ceupysee8</a>] 14-9-2012(): Definition of<strong> pennant</strong>: a long, tapering flag of significance used in signaling or identification. Story: Sentries at guard towers use<strong> pennant</strong> towels as signals to signal other guard posts. [sound+spear=guard post, a post where you constantly hear the sounds of spears as guards spar].

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 11-11-2011(): After the team won the<strong> pennant</strong>, they came out of the locker room wearing only <em>towels</em> to take a bow to the deafening <em>kazoos</em>. To differentiate banner and<strong> pennant</strong>, I associate<strong> pennant</strong> with baseball games and noisy (kazoo) stadiums, and banner sounds like bango 番号 .
