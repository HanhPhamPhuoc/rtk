## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(154): Stroke order: I like to think of the first two strokes as “chop sticks” with which one eats the<strong> rice</strong>. The rest then is the “tree” meaning “plant” in this contexct. also: USA. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 19-12-2007(52): Two <em>drops</em> of<strong> rice</strong> in a <em>tree</em>, simple. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(23): 88! Japanese people think of this Kanji as 88. Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods inside. Anyway, that is the origins of this kanji. It&#039;s easy to remember: Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/八十八">八十八</a>  　written as one character. just remember one   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/八">八</a>  　is upside down. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 29-9-2006(10): Avoid <em>rice-grains</em> in stories that use the full 6-stroke   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/米">米</a>  , use cups of<strong> rice</strong> instead. Reserve <em>rice-grains</em> for the abbreviated 5-stroke version as in <a href="../932">lacquer</a> <span class="index">(#932 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/漆">漆</a>)</span>漆 and <a href="../933">Esq.</a> <span class="index">(#933 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/様">様</a>)</span>様.

Henshall says (in the entry for   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/寿">寿</a>  , ＃1351, p. 431): &quot;Note that eighty-eight is considered a particularly felicitous age, owing to the fact that the character for<strong> rice</strong> (a symbol of bounty and the life-force),   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/米">米</a>  ..., can be graphically interpreted as ten   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/十">十</a>  ..., times eight [upside-down] ハ..., with a further eight ハ...&quot;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/米寿">米寿</a>  【べいじゅ】88th birthday.
