## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(239): If your <strong>potato</strong>s are growing <em>flowers</em> and those little <em>hooked roots</em>, you should either buy less or eat them faster.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 3-2-2008(77): If your<strong> potato</strong>es are growing <em>flowers</em>, you need to store them in a more <em>dry</em> place, like hanging them on <em>hooks</em> so they don&#039;t accumulate moisture on the floor.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 4-5-2008(53): Believe it or not, originally the <strong>potato</strong> was cultivated because of its beautiful <em>flowers</em> rather than for eating the actual &quot;<em>potato</em>&quot; below. (historical fact).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-1-2006(18): Tip : the bottom primitive (<em>potato with hooks</em>) can be thought of as &quot;Mr<strong> Potato</strong> Head&quot;, the toy patented in 1952 with which you can make faces. This <em>potato</em> has little <em>hooks</em> onto which you can attach ears, noses, glasses, etc. to make all sorts of faces.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Murjab">Murjab</a>] 1-12-2008(10): The<strong> potato</strong> plant consists of both flowers and the root below. The root (the part of a plant that hooks into the soil), is all that most people think of when they hear the word &quot;potato.&quot; Therefore, while the kanji for <strong>potato</strong> contains all parts of the plant - flowers and roots - as a primitive, only focus on the important part - the roots.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 16-3-2009(8): The first thing a cook needs to know about the<strong> potato</strong> is that the <strong>flowers and leaves</strong> on the top of the plant are poisonous. Only the tubers at the bottom are edible. Clueless cooks at the court of Queen Elizabeth didn&#039;t know this... See <a href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PotatoHistory.htm">http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PotatoHistory.htm</a> for a full account (middle of page, date is 1589).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/morganandrew">morganandrew</a>] 27-3-2010(4): You know your<strong> potato</strong> is the real<strong> potato</strong> and not the primitive when it has sprouted FLOWERS.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nmkohi">nmkohi</a>] 24-7-2006(4): If your<strong> potato</strong>es start to flower it&#039;s time to throw them away.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 11-11-2012(3): When you are hungry you search <strong>potatos</strong> under the ground rather than being interested in all the <em>flowers</em> growing above the ground. ( 一 is the ground of the street 丁 ).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Miyumera">Miyumera</a>] 29-6-2012(2): <strong>Potato</strong>e Primitive:<strong> potato</strong>es should be kept DRY by hanging them on HOOKs on the clothesline since they can&#039;t be put on regular hangers. Picture 10<strong> potato</strong>es on hooks. Story: The<strong> POTATO</strong>ES are starting to grow FLOWERS!
