## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 15-8-2006(255): In the <em>Old West</em>, they used to light <em>fires</em> in the <em>ground</em> to make<strong> smoke</strong> signals.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 14-10-2007(59): Should be easy.<strong> SMOKE</strong> brings to mind &quot;Where there&#039;s<strong> SMOKE</strong>, there&#039;s FIRE&quot;. So, the FIRE in the OLD WEST can tell people we&#039;re you&#039;re at, so put out the FIRE with SOIL to keep the<strong> SMOKE</strong> to a minimum.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 19-9-2006(18): In the <em>old west</em> people not only <em>fired</em> up and<strong> smoke</strong>d tobacco filling the air with its<strong> smoke</strong> but they chewed it too, spitting it on the <em>ground</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 4-8-2008(13): Clint sits by the fire on the dirt, smoking his cigarillo, watching the<strong> smoke</strong> float up slowly. This is his ideal way to spend time.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/childofthetao">childofthetao</a>] 20-8-2011(11): They used to light <em>fires</em> in the <em>Old West</em> on the <em>ground</em> to make<strong> smoke</strong> signals.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 18-6-2008(8): In the <em>old west</em> bandits often built <em>fires</em> on the <em>ground</em> to sleep around and keep warm. The drawback, however, was that these fires would give off<strong> smoke</strong>, giving away their wareabouts. Not good if you&#039;re a train robber fleeing the law...

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 26-6-2009(4): Where theres<strong> smoke</strong>, theres fire. Where theres fire, theres westies. Where theres westies, theres dirt.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-4-2006(4): In this <em>Old West</em> town one of the elders had a habit of throwing some dirt (<em>soil</em>) into the <em>fireplace</em> whenever he was back home, some kind of ritual. Little did he know that the heavy<strong> smoke</strong> coming out of the chimney was interpreted by the neighbour Indian tribes as a &quot;quarantine&quot; message. The old man&#039;s seemingly pointless ritual was the sole reason that his town was never attacked by the Indians.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 7-7-2008(3): Why are my ribs the best? We<strong> smoke</strong> them, of course. We let them sit in a big <em>fire</em> till they&#039;re nice and burnt (till there&#039;s so much<strong> smoke</strong> that they must be cooked), then once they&#039;re cooked, we dump some <em>old west</em> sauce on the <em>ground</em> and kick the meat around till it&#039;s coated in sauce and dirt. Nothing like smoky charred flavor and dirt! Yummy!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/swaarm">swaarm</a>] 26-6-2012(2): The easiest way to find cowbows in the <em>old west</em> was to look for<strong> smoke</strong> in the distance, follow it, and find a camp<em>fire</em> with cowboys sleeping on the <em>ground</em> around it.
