## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 17-2-2008(148): &quot;Sayeth&quot;?! Who the hell says &quot;sayeth&quot;? Doesn&#039;t seem quite right...just like this kanji, which is just like &quot;day&quot; but doesn&#039;t seem &quot;quite right.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 10-4-2008(87): When <em>pent up</em> alone, <em>one</em><strong> sayeth</strong> little.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iheckman">iheckman</a>] 2-6-2008(45): So I don&#039;t mix with <a href="../v4/1117">speaketh</a> (#1117 申).<strong> Sayeth</strong> rhymes with dayeth.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/niktok">niktok</a>] 5-9-2007(22): So<strong> SAYETH</strong> we all. They are pent in on galactica, as one family.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 27-3-2008(16): One pent up tongue<strong> sayeth</strong> little.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 27-4-2009(11): The SUN<strong> SAYETH</strong> unto the DAY, &quot;Dost thou knoweth for what reason our middle line is shortened?&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 17-2-2011(10): <strong>Sayeth</strong> is an older form of &#039;say&#039;, from back when the language was less-developed...just as this kanji is a less-developed form of &#039;tongue wagging in mouth&#039;. 曰く いわくpretext; history; past; story; 曰く言い難し いわくいいがたし It is hard to explain, It is hard to say.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 5-12-2007(6): This is an old form of a <em>wagging tongue</em>, from a time when it was not finished. See, the tongue has not yet reached the side.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/michel">michel</a>] 19-8-2007(5): Tongue in mouth<strong> sayeth</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennatan1">bennatan1</a>] 28-11-2010(4): Not dayeth but<strong> sayeth</strong>.
