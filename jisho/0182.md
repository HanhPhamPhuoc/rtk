heisig: "The word <b>trunk</b> refers to the <i>part of the body</i> that is left when you have &quot;<b>truncated</b>&quot; all the limbs. I can hardly think of any reason for doing so, unless one were lumberjacking corpses and needed to have them all properly pruned and made the <i>same</i> so they could be floated downstream without causing a <i>body</i>-jam."
