heisig: As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a <i>tree</i> that is <b>not yet</b> fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the <i>tree</i> has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the <i>tree</i>.
