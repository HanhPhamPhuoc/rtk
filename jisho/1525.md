## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-1-2006(194): Behold the &quot;Boulev&#039;Art&quot; : a life-size section of a boulevard cast in a huge block of resin. Some call it ...<strong> art</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thermal">thermal</a>] 30-6-2008(58): The definition of<strong> art</strong> is getting more and more loose these days. Why even some <em>resin</em> spilled onto the <em>boulevard</em> is now counted as<strong> art</strong>! Hmmph!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 5-2-2008(25): I get it, when the <em>resin</em> is on a <em>boulevard</em> instead of a road (see complaints in <a href="../1524">mention</a> (#1524 述)), it&#039;s<strong> art</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-3-2007(22): The violinists(<em>resin</em>) practive their <strong>art</strong> on the <em>boulevard</em> much to the pleasure of passersby.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 27-5-2006(21): An modert<strong> art</strong>ist exposes his sculpute on a boulevard.... here you can see his latestest creation, a sculputure made out of resin.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shuusaku">shuusaku</a>] 9-1-2013(9): When you put the <em>CELL PHONE TOWER</em> in the middle of a <em>BOULEVARD</em> in Barcelona, instead, you get an example of modern<strong> ART</strong> (see also <a href="../1524">mention</a> (#1524 述)).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 6-12-2008(5): The <em>boulevard</em> of <em>resin</em> is where is the<strong> art</strong>sy people live.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 7-1-2008(5): An modern<strong> art</strong>ist displays his latest<strong> ART</strong> on the <em>boulevard</em> - a sculpture made of resin. (tweaked dingomick&#039;s story slightly). Nitpick: The chemist in me needs to point out that violinists (and gymnasts, etc) use rosin, not resin to make things stickier.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sabretou">sabretou</a>] 8-3-2011(4): Sorry for going pictograph mode, but this reminds me of an &quot;<strong>art</strong> installation&quot; by a guerilla<strong> art</strong> group in Russia. They painted a giant penis (middle of the kanji) on an over-river bridge (right of the kanji), so that when it was raised (left of kanji) to let boats through, the &quot;penis&quot; got &quot;erected&quot; facing a government building.<strong> Art</strong> or not, that was one ballsy stunt (no pun intended). Here&#039;s a picture of it (NSFW obviously): <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6yp96pc">http://tinyurl.com/6yp96pc</a>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 14-2-2008(4): <strong>Art</strong> sculptures made of resin and displayed on the boulevard.
