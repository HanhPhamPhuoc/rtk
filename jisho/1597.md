heisig: At the top we have <i>the animal horns</i> and the single horizontal stroke to give them something to hang onto. Below that, we see one <i>rake</i> with two handles. Finally, we see a pair of strokes splitting away from each of the handles, indicating that they are both splitting under the pressure. The composite picture is of someone holding down two jobs <b>concurrently</b>, using the same kit of tools to move in two different directions and ending up in a mess. Take the time to find this sense in the kanji and it will be easy to remember, despite initial appearances.
