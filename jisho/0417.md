heisig: "To construct a <b>building</b>, you first draw a set of plans (the writing <i>brush</i>) and then <i>s-t-r-e-t-c-h </i>your drawing out to scale in reality. stretch(rozciagac) The primitive meaning to stretch might at first seem similar to that for road. Take a moment to study it more carefully and you will see the difference. Like road, this character holds other primitives above its sweeping final stroke. [3]"
