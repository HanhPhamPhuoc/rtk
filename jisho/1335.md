## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 8-11-2007(200): After a day being <em>virtuouos</em> and keeping the city safe, <em>Spiderman</em>&#039;s outfit is in need of some repair. Luckily, as he can shoot out threads<strong> darning</strong> is very easy for him to do. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 7-7-2007(60): <strong>Darning</strong> is too obscure a word for me, I prefer to just think of it as repair. And obviously, repairing someones broken cloth things is a virtuous thing to do, and you need thread to do it. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 19-3-2008(49): <em>Spiderman</em> is of course <em>virtuous</em> and spends a lot of time<strong> darning</strong> his costume after battles so that his privates don&#039;t show. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto">akimoto</a>] 1-3-2007(24): <strong>Darning</strong> socks instead of buying new ones shows the virtousness of the person - it exhibits the Japanese virtue of thrift (the Meiji emperor would refuse to buy new boots, constantly having them repaired. The Showa emperor would refuse to buy books he wanted because he &quot;couldn&#039;t afford them.&quot;). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 13-9-2007(19): The <em>thread</em> is too <em>virtuous</em> for damning; it can only be used for<strong> darning</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 22-12-2009(13): <strong>Darning</strong> is a <em>virtuous</em> use of <em>thread</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pippip">pippip</a>] 10-10-2009(13): 　SPIDERMAN is too VIRTUOUS to say F**K so he says darn instead. This has him always<strong> darning</strong> the things that need mending..&quot;Oh, Darn this silly costume!&quot;.......RTK2:　ゼン　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/修繕">修繕</a>  　しゅうぜん(mending)…　Pure Group:　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/善">善</a>  1035. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 9-2-2010(6): Don&#039;t listen to Rakushun.<strong> Darning</strong> is a perfect keyword. It just goes to show how clever keywording can be.<strong> Darning</strong> has connotations of threading, even though this has nothing to do with<strong> darning</strong>,<strong> darning</strong> has everything to do with &#039;repairing&#039; and &#039;mending&#039; so I recommend people to keep the keyword<strong> darning</strong> as it will indefinitely bring up the thread primitive, all you gotta do is work around being virtuous into it. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 12-8-2009(4): Spidey the virtuous, darns socks for the poor. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 20-8-2008(4): <em>Spiderman</em>&#039;s gramda is a <em>virtuous</em> lady, always ready to do some<strong> darning</strong> for him if he rips his outfit.
