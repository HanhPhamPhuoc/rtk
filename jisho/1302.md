## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 24-9-2007(194): [Smithsonian] Scene: <em>Mr. T</em> hanging from the <em>ceiling</em> being tortured. He is asked if he is going to talk. Spitting (a <em>drop</em> of saliva) in the torturer&#039;s face, he says &quot;Negative&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 20-8-2007(45): <em>One below</em> zero is a<strong> negative</strong> number.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 4-6-2006(29): If just ONE PERSON has a DROP of NEGATIVITY it can make everyone<strong> NEGATIVE</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 22-1-2011(13): A minus sign with an arrow pointing up at it, indicating that this is the symbol that means<strong> negative</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/owenjd">owenjd</a>] 9-11-2008(12): Anything smaller than 1 is<strong> negative</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonjimbo2000">jonjimbo2000</a>] 5-6-2008(9): Pictograph. Looks a bit like a combination of フ and F for fail - very<strong> negative</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 11-7-2010(4): 不安 , 不満 , 不便 <a href="../v4/1217">negative</a> (#1217 不) フ, ブ ... Parts: 一 , 亻, 丶 ... Note: IRL it is hard to tell 不 <a href="../v4/1217">negative</a> (#1217 不), 無 <a href="../v4/1775">nothingness</a> (#1775 無), 非 <a href="../v4/1632">un-</a> (#1632 非) apart, meaning-wise. They are all prefixes that negate, like the English prefixes &#039;un&#039; and &#039;in&#039;. Worse yet, both 不 , and 無 can be pronounced ブ. Fun fact: &#039;Fu&#039; in kana (フand ふ) both came from this Kanji. ... 熟語 : 不倫 , 不足 , 不景気 ... cf: 至 .

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 1-4-2009(4): (Looks like a ceiling and an arrow pointing up)<strong> Negative</strong> people are always pointing up towards the ceiling to show how far down they still are.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 6-3-2007(4): Hanging from the <em>ceiling</em>, <em>Mr. T</em> spits out a <em>drop</em> of saliva in the hopes that the<strong> negative</strong> weight will allow him to climb to safety.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 22-10-2006(4): [negative; non-; bad; ugly; clumsy] Think of the horizontal line as the Y axis of a 2d graphic. All other lines are below it, so they have a <strong>negative</strong> y value.
