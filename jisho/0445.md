## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 17-12-2007(148): <strong>Warning:</strong> The left part is NOT the primitive <em>turtle</em>! The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 20-3-2008(122): In the<strong> north</strong>, the weather is so cold that people are often seen sitting back to back to preserve warmth.

The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference! My &#039;story&#039;: There are NO <em>turtles</em> at the <strong>North</strong> Pole. What looks like turtle-backs are actually Igloos, so small you can barely <em>sit</em> inside them. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown">alatown</a>] 5-8-2009(17): The<strong> north</strong> is cold, so why doesn&#039;t this couple spoon to keep warm? 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 9-4-2008(11): People! this has nothing to do with turtles. The strokes are different. Don&#039;t use turtle in this story. Just stick to the people sitting back to back in the cold<strong> north</strong>.

I never got the stroke order, or the shape, or the stroke count of the left side correct until I realized that it is the <em>Fingers primitive with the tips broken off</em>. , so Beware <em>sitting on the ground</em> at the <strong>North</strong> Pole (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/北極点">北極点</a>  ): you&#039;ll get frostbite, and the <em>Tips of your Fingers will fall off</em>.

No response. &quot;Joe? Joe?! ... Are you ok?&quot; To Fred&#039;s horror, he finds that Joe is frozen solid, his arms and legs out straight. Fred is at first devastated, but when help still fails to arrive, he is forced to grab a <em>spoon</em> and enjoy Joe &quot;Alive&quot; style.
