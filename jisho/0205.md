heisig: "You have no doubt seen how people practicing the Japanese art of bonsai take those helpless little saplings and twist them into crippled dwarves before they have a chance to grow up as they should. The more proper way to <b>plant</b> a young <i>tree</i> and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up <i>straight</i>."

Well, now imagine a slow-witted carpenter who thought he could<strong> plant</strong> a tree and get <em>wood</em> <em>straightaway</em>! It would take a long time for him to build your house.
