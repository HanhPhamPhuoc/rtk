## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikemikepw">mikemikepw</a>] 19-9-2007(166): A space<strong> cadet</strong> eager to make one bend around the sun. (a dangerous maneuver).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 23-12-2008(134): <em>Bender</em> lasted just <em>one day</em> in the space<strong> cadet</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 19-6-2009(49): Japanese<strong> cadet</strong>s have to constantly do <em>one</em> thing--<em>bend</em> OVER all <em>day</em>, bowing to their superiors.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 25-10-2005(41): Hint : As a primitive I use the image of Bender the robot from the animated series &quot;Futurama&quot; (by the same creator as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;). Here Bender is a<strong> cadet</strong> at the army, and the sergeant who is blinded by the sun reflected on Bender&#039;s metallic body, keeps saying &quot;this<strong> cadet</strong> is <em>one</em> -insert random expletive- <em>bend</em>er of the <em>sun</em>!&quot; (meaning Bender bends the sun&#039;s rays).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 12-9-2007(22): This is from back in <em>Bender</em>&#039;s early days, when he was a promising young space<strong> cadet</strong> at the evil empire academy. He had one task - blow up <em>one</em> <em>sun</em>. <em>One</em>. <em>Sun</em>. That they had set up for him beforehand. Well, he ended up blowing up the entire solar system his outfit was stationed in. When he got called in for a meeting, the commander said: &quot;Cadet <em>Bender</em>, you were asked to blow up <em>one</em> <em>sun</em>. At this rate, you&#039;ll never be more than a<strong> cadet</strong>&quot;. <em>Bender</em>: &quot;Screw this, I&#039;m outta here&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/testoman">testoman</a>] 9-7-2008(12): <strong>Cadet</strong> <em>Bender</em> is <em>one</em> <em>sun</em> of a bitch.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 8-1-2008(7): Imagine a military uniform where rank is indicated by bent stripes on the sleeve.<strong> Cadet</strong>s, having the lowest rank, have only <em>one</em> <em>bent</em> stripe. Furthermore, the<strong> cadet</strong> has to stand at attention all day in the blazing <em>sun</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 15-6-2006(7): <em>one</em><strong> cadet</strong> is under punishment ... he is <em>spending</em> all day doing knee <em>bends</em> all <em>day</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 3-5-2006(6): This looks to me like a violin, like a guitar (see bend) with an extra stroke for the bow. A busker plays his violin all day to make a living. Maybe the<strong> cadet</strong> used to be a busker and joined the army band.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 10-2-2010(5): It takes only ONE DAY in the SUN to BEND the BRAINS of a<strong> CADET</strong>!
