## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 24-7-2007(173): A<strong> sketch</strong> is a <a href="../v4/234">seedling</a> (#234 苗) of things to come. Before the assault, the sergeant draws a<strong> sketch</strong> of the attack with his fingers in the sand.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 16-12-2006(125): I&#039;m bad at drawing, so when I try to<strong> sketch</strong> the kanji for cat, you can sort of recognize it, but I don&#039;t get the curve of the &quot;wild dogs&quot; just right.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rosgmact">rosgmact</a>] 13-8-2007(68): You chop off one of your FINGERs and plant it like a SEEDLING, planning to<strong> sketch</strong> it daily to show its progress. Unfortunately, all your<strong> sketch</strong>es are the same - fingers don&#039;t grow like that, you see... plus one of your hands is now a bloody mess and<strong> sketch</strong>ing doesn&#039;t come too easily with a paw like that. All in all, a very bad idea which has done nothing to hone your artistic talent; in fact, you have only impaired it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 10-4-2008(57): Isn&#039;t <em>finger</em> paint great? This kanji shows a kid <em>finger</em> painting a<strong> sketch</strong> of a <em>flowery field</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/OddAndersen">OddAndersen</a>] 17-4-2008(30): A <strong>sketch</strong> can be considered the <em>seedling</em> of a full-fledged technical drawing. Contrary to the drawing itself, which require exact measures, rulers, compasses, etc., the <strong>sketch</strong> can be roughly drawn up using only your <em>fingers</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Skinny">Skinny</a>] 15-2-2009(14): With my fingers, I<strong> sketch</strong> in the dirt where I want the seedlings.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 30-6-2008(11): I was<strong> SKETCH</strong>ing a detailed picture of a <a href="../v4/244">cat</a> (#244 猫), but my <em>fingers</em> were getting sore and I didn&#039;t finish all the little strokes on its tail... (the story itself differentiates b/w the &#039;pack of wild dog&#039; and &#039;finger&#039; primitives, so don&#039;t worry about getting the two kanji confused).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sanshinboy">sanshinboy</a>] 19-1-2011(7): I am very bad at finger painting. all i can<strong> sketch</strong> are flowers and fields....lame!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 18-5-2009(7): A<strong> sketch</strong> is using your <em>fingers</em> to create a <em>seedling</em> of the finalized project.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 30-9-2010(5): In the days before cameras, botanists&#039; expeditions would include an artist whose nimble <em>fingers</em> could<strong> sketch</strong> all the <em>seedlings</em> to illustrate their field guides.
