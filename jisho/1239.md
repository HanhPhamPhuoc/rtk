## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 5-3-2007(214): The<strong> No.</strong> 1 currency in the world is the <em>dollar</em>. But, the Asian nations are fast catching up and may in reality have already surpassed it. So, let the <em>bamboo</em> represent the<strong> No.</strong> 2 currencies (the yen, etc.). The reverse order (<em>bamboo</em> on top and the <em>dollar</em> on the bottom) is really a look at the future.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 10-1-2009(101): The<strong> No.</strong>1 currency may at one time have been the dollar, but since the economic slowdown the <em>weak dollar</em> has been overtaken by currencies from <em>bamboo</em> growing countries. (Thanks to Johnnyltn for the idea.) Using the alternate writing of the dollar primitive as weak dollar.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 30-4-2008(63): <em>Bamboo</em> <em>bling</em> is the newest Asian Rapper,<strong> No.</strong> 1 on the charts right now.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 24-6-2007(19): The pole vaulter wants to be<strong> No.</strong> 1, so designs a <em>bamboo</em> pole with <em>dollar signs</em> painted on it. (The shape of a pole signifies this is the 1-stroke $).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 21-5-2007(15): Even in the <em>bamboo</em> forests of Southeast Asia, the <em>US Dollar</em> is the<strong> No.</strong> 1 currency in demand. (well, it is true of Cambodia at least).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd">eightyd</a>] 29-8-2009(12): In Japan all<strong> No.</strong> 2 pencils are made of bamboo and are expensive as hell.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kunzen">kunzen</a>] 21-2-2010(11): I don&#039;t see how Heisig gets &quot;dollar sign&quot; here. This is condolences with an extra stroke. Story: I was looking for the house<strong> No.</strong> for my friend to offer my CONDOLENCES after the death of his mother, and found the house by the bent BAMBOO WALKING STICK his mother used to use standing by the door.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yuta73">Yuta73</a>] 29-2-2012(10): Be carefull!!. This means <strong>No. (ordinal)</strong>, not just <strong>No.1</strong>. Avoid conflicts with 壱 <a href="../457">I (one)</a> (#457 壱). &quot;It&#039;s the <strong>No.</strong> zillionth time I have to use a <em>few dollars</em> to buy more <em>bamboo</em> for repairing my <strong>residence</strong>!&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 15-3-2009(8): Since the <em>dollar sign</em> appears to be on the way out as the symbol of the<strong> No.</strong> 1 currency, <em>bamboo</em> may actually top it in value before long.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 3-12-2009(6): The<strong> No.</strong> 1 rapper is K K Bling.
