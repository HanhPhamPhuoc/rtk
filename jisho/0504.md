## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto">akimoto</a>] 14-3-2007(238): My girlfiend saw someone wearing the exact same (duplicate) outfit at a party, so she doubled back to change!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 13-8-2007(187): In <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, Hermione uses a device called a &quot;time-turner&quot; to <em>double back</em> in time, but this creates<strong> duplicate</strong>s. The smart thing to do would be to combine Hermione&#039;s time-turner with Harry&#039;s invisibility cloak. That way, one could <em>double back</em> in time without creating any visible<strong> duplicate</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 13-7-2008(52): The magician took his CLOAK, FOLDED IT (DOUBLE BACKED IT) and <strong>DUPLICATED</strong> it!! Amaaaazing.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 11-7-2007(32): St. Martin took his <em>cloak</em>, <em>doubled it back</em>, and cut it into two pieces effectively making a<strong> duplicate</strong> of his cape (duplicape) for the beggar.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nihonnub">Nihonnub</a>] 29-5-2009(14): My girlfriend noticed that someone was wearing an exact<strong> duplicate</strong> of the <em>cloak</em> she was told was one of a kind! So, she <em>laid</em> there, <em>tongue wagging</em>, <em>legs</em> kicking throwing a right hissy fit![[I have trouble remembering &#039;double back&#039;.. hope this helps anyone else who has the same problem! Also, thanks to akimoto for the girlfriend story]].

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 8-4-2007(13): This <em>cloak</em> will allow Marty McFly to <em>double back</em> to the future. Oh crap, now that he did it he sees his<strong> DUPLICATE</strong> self!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Phil2Musashi">Phil2Musashi</a>] 6-4-2009(12): Once I realized that this one-of-a-kind, rare cloak was actually a<strong> duplicate</strong>, I doubled-back to the store to return it. When the shop keep saw the cloak, he nearly doubled-over himself trying to escape!
