## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 10-1-2009(28): A <strong>plantain</strong> is a <em>flower</em>ing fruit that looks kind of like a banana, and of course bananas look sort of like a comma, so you might even say that they have a sort of <em>comma-design</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 30-9-2006(10): Southern cities in Europe often have<strong> plantain</strong>s for street decoration. The light filtering through these <em>plants</em> makes for a nice light <em>mosaic</em> on the streets.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thairob">thairob</a>] 4-8-2008(6): Little known fact is that the RUBIC&#039;S CUBE was inspired by<strong> PLANTAIN</strong> FLOWERS. The flowers are very colorful and kids in third world countries routinely pick them and play puzzle games with them. The Rubic&#039;s Cube founder saw this and it sparked the idea that turned him into a billionaire...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 25-1-2008(5): The<strong> plantain</strong> is a giant banana. If you look closely at it&#039;s <em>flower</em> you will see it looks like a <em>mosaic</em> of bananas.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 12-8-2009(3): Due to the<strong> plantain</strong>&#039;s phallic appearance, NHK only broadcasts images of the plant, flowers and all, that are covered by a mosaic.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 2-11-2010(1): &quot;Honey, I&#039;ll give you these <em>flowers</em> if you can solve this <em>rubix cube</em> in the time it takes me to peel and eat this<strong> plantain</strong>.&quot; Imagine your significant other frantically trying to solve the rubix cube while you casually eat the large banana-like<strong> plantain</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 8-6-2010(1): (NB: Following Halpern&#039;s <em>Kanji Learner&#039;s Dictionary</em>, I call 芭 <strong>BANANA</strong> and call 蕉 <em>PLANTAIN</em>; this is the reverse from RTK&#039;s keywords for these two characters; I find it easier to make the stories this way.) This is one sick <strong>BANANA</strong> tree: it&#039;s <em>FLOWER</em> shows signs of having being attacked by a <em>MOSAIC</em> virus.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 27-1-2009(1): The HIPPIE sees his<strong> plantain</strong> in PIXELS, after he smoked its leafs.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 16-1-2009(1): <strong>Plantain</strong> is a big banana that kind of has a weird color.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceupysee8">Ceupysee8</a>] 18-9-2012(): I&#039;ve always had so much trouble telling apart bananas and<strong> plantain</strong>s - it&#039;s like trying to solve a rubix cube for me. Friend: &quot;Why?<strong> plantain</strong>s are always green and bananas are yellow...&quot; Me: &quot;That doesn&#039;t help if I&#039;m colorblind&quot;.
