## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zhangqiezi">zhangqiezi</a>] 29-5-2008(230): If you&#039;ve ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you&#039;ll remember that every <em>town</em> was all bordered off by a line of <em>trees</em> with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were <em>glued together</em> so you could only exit<strong> town</strong> through the main or side gates, (so you couldn&#039;t escape the important scripted scenes.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 3-4-2009(162): Pfft. At it&#039;s core, a<strong> town</strong> is just a bunch of <em>wood</em> <em>glued</em> together. Edit - Stop starring this piece of crap story! xD.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sunday">Sunday</a>] 8-3-2008(65): There is a mix up, this kanji means むら=village, not<strong> town</strong>. The one for<strong> town</strong> is まち　= 町 . 100% shure because my teacher is native Japanese.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kieron">Kieron</a>] 3-7-2007(57): I swap the <em>town/village</em> keywords. See also <a href="../92">village</a> (#92 町). As the old Siberian joke went, there&#039;s nothing to do in a small rural <strong>village</strong> but count (<em>measure</em>) the <em>trees</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MikeNeko">MikeNeko</a>] 21-6-2008(48): 村 means village! See <a href="../92">village</a> (#92 町). Please don&#039;t get them confused like Heisig seems to have done. Story: See the <em>tree</em>s surround the little <strong>village</strong> so densely it looks like they are <em>glued</em> together. Imagine a little village on a hillside surrounded by trees with glue dripping off the trees.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc">mcbainpc</a>] 25-6-2008(17): The size of a<strong> town</strong> is measured by its trees.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kresobilan">kresobilan</a>] 27-2-2008(13): Historically, villages were not defended and<strong> town</strong>s were. The 1st fence that was built would be palisade, or really, thickly arranged (<em>glued</em>) <em>wood</em>en spikes.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 26-10-2008(8): This is actually the Kanji for <strong>village</strong>. The story for that is that the size of any <strong>village</strong> is &quot;measured&quot; by how much &quot;wood&quot; it consumes for building and heating!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 5-7-2010(7): It means village NOT<strong> TOWN</strong>!!!, Heisig can be a cunt sometimes... ^^)).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nayelianne">Nayelianne</a>] 21-9-2008(5): A <strong>village</strong> is surrounded by so many <em>trees</em> that you can&#039;t even <em>measure</em> how small it is. Just <em>measure</em> your steps and you&#039;ll find a <strong>village</strong> hidden deep between the <em>trees</em>.
