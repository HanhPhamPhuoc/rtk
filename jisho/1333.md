heisig: "Remember when your granny used to ask you to bend your arms at the <i>elbows</i> and hold them out so that she could use them like a rack to hold a skein of string or yarn (here <b>thread</b>) while she rolled it up into a <i>little</i> ball? Now can you see the two <i>elbows</i> (with the second stroke doubling up) at the top, and the character for <i>little</i> below?"
