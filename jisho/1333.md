## Heisig story:

Remember when your granny used to ask you to bend your arms at the <i>elbows</i> and hold them out so that she could use them like a rack to hold a skein of string or yarn (here <b>thread</b>) while she rolled it up into a <i>little</i> ball? Now can you see the two <i>elbows</i> (with the second stroke doubling up) at the top, and the character for <i>little</i> below?

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lerris">lerris</a>] 3-7-2007(195): I also went with Spiderman. However, in the cases where this primitive appears under other primitives, as opposed to on the left (I think there are ~5 times in this chapter) I&#039;ve opted to use a similar character: Venom. This helps keep the positioning clear, especially on such characters as <a href="../1363">dainty</a> (#1363 細) and <a href="../1364">accumulate</a> (#1364 累).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa">Piitaa</a>] 17-7-2006(81): You&#039;ll be seeing this one a lot. Seriously.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 28-7-2007(56): On left with nothing on top of it --&gt; SPIDERMAN. everywhere else....SPIDERPIG.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 14-6-2007(20): I&#039;ll stick with Spiderman. He&#039;s a very memorable character, and don&#039;t forget that he can shoot strings from both arms. What happens to the relative primitive when Spiderman comes along? If you can clearly picture his<strong> thread</strong>s winding, pulling, yanking, sticking to, filling, tying, and strangling objects, then you&#039;ll never confuse this primitive with another one.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac">aphasiac</a>] 13-10-2009(16): Hate to be pedantic, but it&#039;s spelt <em>Spider-man</em>, not <em>Spiderman</em>. Stan Lee added the hyphen to differentiate him from <em>Superman</em>..

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 14-2-2011(15): Spiderman, spiderman, does whatever a spider can. Spins a<strong> thread</strong>, any size, &#039;specially small, he wins a prize...look out! Here comes a spider maaaaaaaaan! 糸 (いと) :<strong> thread</strong>; 毛糸 (けいと) : knitting wool.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 5-1-2010(11): <em>If you don&#039;t want to use Spiderman for this primitive, I suggest &#039;old sweater&#039;</em>. <strong> Mnemonic: an old sweater has <em>small</em> holes in the <em>elbows</em>.</strong> The edges are frayed and <strong>threads </strong>are hanging loosely around the edges. Pull them out, twine them around your finger, etc. to get a feel for it.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ddstevenson">ddstevenson</a>] 1-5-2013(7): When on the bottom, I&#039;m calling this primitive a string bikini. When it appears on the left, it&#039;ll be Spider-Man.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 5-7-2009(6): I don&#039;t really know Spiderman that well... so, I need a new primitive. What will it be? Well, it will be any story involving <strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong>. After all, how many damn<strong> thread</strong>s must there be on internet message boards talking about that game? It&#039;s a picture of Tifa, <em>elbows bent</em> and ready for battle, with a surprisingly <em>small</em> build despite her huge... hmm, you know.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brianobush">brianobush</a>] 22-5-2009(6): [Silk Bra for when it&#039;s to the side, Silk Panties for when it&#039;s below] Her elbows where totally explosed in her new new little silky<strong> thread</strong>s.
