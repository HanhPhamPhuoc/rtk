## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Birdsong">Birdsong</a>] 26-4-2007(341): The king of<strong> LOGIC</strong> is the computer.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg">johanvg</a>] 16-7-2006(33): Computers are ruled by<strong> logic</strong> (it is the king of computers).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(29): If you used the meaning &quot;House of the Parents&quot; for <a href="../173">ri</a> (#173 里), you will know then that, as<strong> logic</strong> dictates, the <em>King</em> must rule on his own Kingdom (the <em>House of his Parents</em>).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fjolnir">fjolnir</a>] 29-10-2009(17): The <em>king</em> of<strong> logic</strong> is the <em>computer</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 16-2-2009(12): <strong>LOGIC</strong> reigns <em>king</em> at my <em>parent&#039;s house</em> = no bullshitting my wise mom or dad with silly stories!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 29-6-2008(8): A king allocates how much Ri each person should have, he does this via reason/logic.[Though he is probably corrupted by things such as power and wealth by aristocrats anyway, VIVA LA REVOLUTION]. Perhaps this kanji is trying to show what an ideal state based on justice should be like. I know this story is impossible to grasp from the keyword<strong> logic</strong>, but i figured i may as well use the radical Ri as no one here has used it.
