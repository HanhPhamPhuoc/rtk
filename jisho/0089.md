heisig: The key word <b>vice</b> has the sense of someone second-in-command. The great and flashing <i>saber</i> to the right (its usual location, so you need not worry about where to put it from now on) and the <i>wealth</i> on the left combine to create an image of dividing one's property to give a share to one's <b>vice</b>-<i>wealth</i> holder.
