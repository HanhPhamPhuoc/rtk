## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 1-3-2006(182): A<strong> cold</strong> lunch: in the <em>house</em>, <em>celery</em>, pre cooked <em>animal legs</em> (i.e. chicken drumsticks) and <em>ice</em> tea. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 16-5-2007(104): Some strange animal tried to steal a stalk of celery from my house. However, it was freezing and the floor was covered in ice, so the mysterious animal couldn&#039;t get any traction. Picture a <em>stalk of celery</em> and a <em>pair of animal legs</em> slipping and sliding clumsily around the <em>ice</em>, and never able to leave the <em>house</em>. Eventually it got so<strong> cold</strong> that the little animal froze to death. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 1-2-2008(76): The story of gordon is really great except that there is a tremendous mistake : this kanji is used for the weather , the temperature (samui   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/寒い">寒い</a>   ) .... not for the feeling to the touch : for this one it&#039;s tsumetai   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/冷たい">冷たい</a>   <a href="../1404">cool</a> <span class="index">(#1404 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/冷">冷</a>)</span> the jap HOUSE are infamous for being insanely<strong> cold</strong> . How much<strong> cold</strong> ? you don&#039;t even need a freezer for keeping your CELERY . Worse it&#039;s this much<strong> cold</strong> that there is some ICE on the floor and that you must have arched ANIMAL LEGS like pingoo for moving without falling. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 5-2-2008(40): Did you ever see that Tom and Jerry episode where they made it so<strong> cold</strong> that the inside of the <em>house</em> became a winter wonderland, and Jerry grabbed some <em>celery</em> and used his <em>animal legs</em> to skate and sled around on the <em>ice</em>? It was a real <em>celery</em>-bration, ha ha... ha.. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 31-3-2007(31): When it&#039;s freezing<strong> cold</strong> outside (ice everywhere), it&#039;s best to stay in the house, eating celery (winter vegetable) and wear your bunny slippers (animal legs). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-9-2008(16): You keep your <em>house</em><strong> cold</strong> to keep the <em>celery</em> fresh, but your poor pets&#039; <em>animal legs</em> slip on the <em>ice</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 4-7-2007(9): I hate<strong> cold</strong> <em>houses</em>. They make my <em>human legs</em> turn into <em>iced</em> <em>celery</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 12-2-2008(8): Ghinzdra + radical tyro + Zareon = &quot;I hate<strong> COLD</strong> Japanese HOUSES. They make my legs<strong> cold</strong> like ICED CELERY so I have to wear slippers made from ANIMAL LEGS.&quot; Also, as ghinzdra said, this does not mean a<strong> cold</strong> thing, but a<strong> cold</strong> state, such as weather or a place. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 5-6-2011(7): Though the weather was<strong> cold</strong>, in the <em>house</em> they had to keep the <em>celery</em>, <em>animal legs</em>, and such on <em>ice</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 17-6-2011(5): Don&#039;t mix up with <a href="../1404">cool</a> <span class="index">(#1404 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/冷">冷</a>)</span>, when the cool boys order each other around. This kind of<strong> cold</strong> has to do with weather. When its<strong> cold</strong> outside, I stay at <em>home</em> and have hot <em>celery</em> soup with chicken <em>legs</em> to keep out the <em>ice</em>.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/寒い">寒い</a>  　＝　さむい　＝cold.
