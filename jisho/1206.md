## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 4-7-2007(178): Errata: stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. Top stroke is first.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 16-5-2008(104): The<strong> axe</strong>-wielding maniac <em>nails</em> a poor victim, right under a <em>cliff</em>. Blood everywhere! (thanks scottamus!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 28-5-2008(41): Warning: unlike the nail primitive, notice that the<strong> axe</strong> does not have a hook on the last stroke.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bokuzukuri">bokuzukuri</a>] 14-1-2006(21): Pictograph, see book.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jinkouchinou">jinkouchinou</a>] 9-8-2009(18): The<strong> axe</strong>-wielding maniac nails a poor victim, right under a cliff. Blood everywhere! (thanks scottamus!). [Shibo] Errata: stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. Top stroke is first. [radical_tyro] Warning: unlike the nail primitive, notice that the<strong> axe</strong> does not have a hook on the last stroke. [Ramchip] I just wanted to combine these as they were all very helpful. I take no credit for any of them.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zodiac">zodiac</a>] 1-12-2008(7): For alternate primitive, perhaps Gimli holding his<strong> axe</strong>?

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 19-8-2010(6): 斤目 , 斤量 <a href="../v4/1125">axe</a> (#1125 斤) キン ... Parts: ⺁, T ... Story: This kanji is such a <em>Drag</em> (RTK 1852.9) 斤 , 栃 introduced out of order; <em>Drag</em> not yet learned. Also it&#039;s a weight measurement (160 匁 equals 1 斤 ), so Keyword does not fit to a <em>T</em>. Using <em>Drag</em> the stroke direction makes sense. Both 斤 and 栃 have been introduced out of order, before <em>Drag</em>, but use <em>Drag</em>. Writing starts from Top right. ... 熟語 : ... cf:.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 16-8-2009(5): Pictographs: vertical strokes make handle and horizontal make blade. Story: pounding spike into bottom of cliff with an<strong> axe</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adoette">adoette</a>] 13-12-2010(4): The<strong> axe</strong> is shaped like a <em>T</em> and hidden under the <em>cliff</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 22-10-2008(4): Stupid, fu<strong>kin</strong>/ふきん<strong> axe</strong> ; can&#039;t cut anything ! // 斧斤 =ふきん=axe // キン # jin1 근 (geun).
