## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 26-4-2007(280): <strong>Noh chanting</strong>?!? I meant &quot;NO CHANTING!&quot; Now all you, just shut up! Not another <em>word</em>! Don&#039;t you know that chanting can provoke attacks from the local <em>condor</em>? So, no chanting, and especially no <strong>Noh chanting</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 25-11-2008(42): Picture guy dressed in a condor mask up on stage during Noh performance chanting some words nobody understands. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 18-5-2006(15): In the Andes flies the mythical<strong> Noh Chanting</strong> condor. You can barely spot this king of birds high up in the sky yet you hear its chanting words flow down to the ground. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 10-12-2009(12): <strong>Noh chanting</strong> is simply <em>words</em> which sound like that a <em>vulture</em> would make. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/colinsky">colinsky</a>] 21-1-2009(5): <strong>noh chanters</strong> chant their <em>words</em> in masks that look like <em>condors</em> (condor = the vulture king of the mountain.). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 22-5-2009(3): The <em>words</em> of the<strong> noh chanting</strong> were written by a japanese ancestor of <em>Condorito</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-5-2008(3): On the <em>Disneyland Skyride</em>, there is a list of things to not do - swinging, smoking, throwing trash, etc. But at the bottom, there are some new <em>words</em> posted - <strong>No<strong> Noh Chanting</strong></strong>. It turns out that some <strong>Noh Chanters</strong> rode the <em>Skyride</em> and started up with their <em>words</em>, which caused dangerous vibrations that shook the cords on the <em>Skyride</em> loose. Sadly enough, someone tried it again in 1994, and several people lost their lives, including <em>Socrates</em> (a tram fell on his head). So they shut it down. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 6-8-2009(2): <strong>Noh Chanting</strong> is really useful! After just a few <em>words</em> of<strong> Noh Chanting</strong>, the <em>vulture</em> loitering around my house cleared off. Stole a <em>can of Coke</em> too but who cares? 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 9-3-2008(2): Socrates heads into the mountains, to not disturb anybody, to practice his<strong> Noh chanting</strong>. Its horrible. Wolverine and the 2 condors(that Wolverine was observing) cringe. All three rush into the attack to eliminate that horrible noise. Who will shut up Socrates first? 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiHantaa">KanjiHantaa</a>] 22-4-2013(1): Para Coné, una <strong>canción de nō</strong> se entiende tanto como las <em>palabras</em> de <em>condorito</em>.
