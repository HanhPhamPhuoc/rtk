1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scout">scout</a>] 20-2-2008(152): <em>Mr. T</em> talks about<strong> ethics</strong> at the <em>academic conference</em>. &quot;I pity the fool who gets caught plagarizing someone else&#039;s stuff!&quot;. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-3-2007(82): <em>Mr. T</em> has no <strong>ethics</strong> at the <em>scrapbooking convention</em>. He&#039;ll do whatever it takes to beat all those ladies. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm">adhmm</a>] 23-11-2007(29): One small change from dingomick to make it memorable to me: <em>Mr. T</em> has no <strong>ethics</strong> at the <em>scrapbooking convention</em>. He&#039;ll do whatever it takes to bang all those ladies. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 13-1-2009(20): 侖 = think or be methodical. A <em>person</em> who <em>thinks or acts methodically</em> has<strong> ethics</strong>.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/五倫">五倫</a>   【ごりん】 (n) the 5 Confucian filial-piety relationships;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/社内不倫">社内不倫</a>   【しゃないふりん】 (n) adulterous affair with someone at work;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/人倫">人倫</a>   【じんりん】 (n) human relations; humanity;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/精力絶倫">精力絶倫</a>   【せいりょくぜつりん】being of unbounded energy or sexual stamina;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/沈倫">沈倫</a>   【ちんりん】sinking into obscurity;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/破倫">破倫</a>   【はりん】 (n) immorality; incest;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/比倫">比倫</a>   【ひりん】. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2005(12): Here <em>Mister T</em> discusses<strong> ethics</strong> at a <em>Panini sticker album convention</em> (see previous frame). See, according to Mister T, there is so much &quot;double&quot; stickers when you buy the pack of stickers, that it creates a lot of waster paper and such, and it contributes to pollution, and a waste of resources. Now most people nowadays would think of embryos and stem cell research when thinking about<strong> ethics</strong>, but hey, this is <em>Mister T</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 1-5-2008(6): The scrapbook meeting got out of hand last time, so, for the next meeting, they have Gandalf as a guest speaker to speak about<strong> ethics</strong> at scrapbook meetings. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 22-1-2010(5): <em>Mr. T</em> is very <em>methodical</em> in his<strong> ethics</strong>. Note: see 侖 <a href="../20374">Unicode-0x4f96</a> <span class="index">(#20374 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/侖">侖</a>)</span> for methodical. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 10-10-2009(4): Now when <em>Obama</em> goes to a <em>meeting</em> and anyone brings up the issue of his <em>ethics</em> he can pull out his <em>scrapbook</em> and show them his nobel prize. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 28-6-2009(4): In the middle of the forum <a href="../1820">argument</a> <span class="index">(#1820 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/論">論</a>)</span> about copyright<strong> ethics</strong>, <em>Chuck Norris</em> walks into the room. There&#039;s no more need for words (no <em>word</em> primitive) - anyone who disagrees with <em>Chuck Norris</em> will simply be roundhouse-kicked in the face. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/coinbaahd">coinbaahd</a>] 8-8-2011(3): God damn Mr. T is an active person. Here he is at the scrapbooking meeting giving a lecture on scrapbooking<strong> ethics</strong>. Don&#039;t put naked photos of anybody in your scrapbook. Don&#039;t put captions talking about &quot;pitying fools&quot; or calling people &quot;suckas&quot; in there ect.
