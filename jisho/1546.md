## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 17-7-2006(239): When I was GROWING UP, the<strong> SURFACE</strong> of my SCARF was always covered with snot from blowing my nose on it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 6-8-2008(97): As girls <em>grow up</em>, something slowly <strong>surfaces</strong> from under their <em>scarf</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 25-9-2006(46): <em>Alice</em> got back to the<strong> surface</strong> by climbing up the rabbit hole on an extremely long <em>scarf</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rhclaghorn">rhclaghorn</a>] 12-4-2008(32): Imagine a <em>scarf</em> <em>growing up</em> until it covers the entire<strong> SURFACE</strong> of the world.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fergal">fergal</a>] 28-6-2009(23): It seems to mean &quot;outer layer&quot;. Some animals shed their <strong>surface</strong> as they <em>grow up</em>. If it doesn&#039;t shed fully they end up wearing it like a <em>scarf</em>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac">aphasiac</a>] 29-8-2009(14): When <em>peter pan</em> flies close the<strong> surface</strong> of the ocean, it&#039;s sooo cold he has to wear a <em>scarf</em> Wendy knitted him!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Louismi">Louismi</a>] 4-4-2011(9): When the muslim females are grown up they need to wear a scarf that covers all the<strong> surface</strong> of their body.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 23-12-2009(7): You cannot identify a true <em>gentleman</em> simply by the cut of his <em>garments</em>. The mark of his character lies beneath the<strong> surface</strong>. HINT: I chose &quot;gentleman + garment&quot; instead of &quot;growing up + scarf&quot;. It still allows the character to be reconstructed.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 5-6-2009(6): <strong>Surface</strong>, another hard-to-visualize idea. Fortunately, it also means &quot;front door&quot; which is much easier to use as a primitive.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zer0range">zer0range</a>] 17-4-2009(5): Growing up as an underground mole-man, whenever I went to the<strong> surface</strong> I wore a scarf to avoid scrutiny.
