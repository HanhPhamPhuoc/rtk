## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-10-2005(239): In mathematics, a<strong> conjecture</strong> is a mathematical statement which has been proposed as a true statement, but which no one has yet been able to prove or disprove. Have you heard of the <em>Finger-Turkey</em><strong> conjecture</strong> ? It states that if <em>turkeys</em> had <em>fingers</em>, they would be able to count. Be sure to imagine a turkey with fingers at the tip of its wings, counting from one to ten.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 19-7-2007(87): In the midst of<strong> conjecture</strong> on whether it was done or not, mom stuck her <em>fingers</em> in the <em>turkey</em> to check.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 31-7-2007(45): WRONG<strong> conjecture</strong> -&gt; Fingers evolved from turkeys.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 1-12-2008(35): The correct<strong> conjecture</strong> is that <em>fingers</em> evolved INTO <em>turkeys</em>! I&#039;ll prove it to you with a simple piece of paper...<a href="http://www.blogadilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hand-turkey.jpg">http://www.blogadilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hand-turkey.jpg</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/unicornpuddlefoot">unicornpuddlefoot</a>] 22-11-2008(25): It may only be<strong> conjecture</strong>, but I think he&#039;s fingured the turkey... lol.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 24-7-2007(18): Some scholars have since long<strong> conjecture</strong> that T-Rex where very similar to big turkeys with small fingers. Image a huge several-storeys high turkey!!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret">Wosret</a>] 29-11-2008(10): It is mere<strong> conjecture</strong> that <strong>turkey</strong>s have <strong>fingers</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 2-4-2008(10): When you stick your <em>fingers</em> up the <em>turkey&#039;s</em> hole to put in the stuffing on T-day, you assume that the hole is empty, but that is mere<strong> CONJECTURE</strong>. You may be surprised by what you find!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gyouza">gyouza</a>] 12-7-2010(8): I didn&#039;t know how to eat the <em>turkey</em>, but by watching the other guests I <strong>conjectured</strong> that using your <em>fingers</em> was the proper way.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/natemb">natemb</a>] 20-3-2010(7): I heard a scientific theory that the human <em>fingers</em> evolved their shape to accurately portray <em>turkeys</em> when traced. I suspect this may only be<strong> conjecture</strong>...
