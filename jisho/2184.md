## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(205): (This is <strong>atmosphere</strong> as in ambiance, mood). <em>Rain</em> is only <em>part</em> of the <strong>atmosphere</strong> for a romantic porch date. Food, music, and candles are the rest.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 22-6-2006(43): The part of the sky that is responsible for weather and rain is known as the<strong> atmosphere</strong>. It only occupies part of the sky though.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 22-5-2008(27): The rain isn&#039;t a bad thing--it provides a part of the romantic<strong> atmosphere</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 21-3-2009(16): Our rain only comes from part of the<strong> atmosphere</strong> at the bottom called the troposphere.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 2-4-2008(9): The<strong> ATMOSPHERE</strong> of a good date can be ruined by talking about the WEATHER or PARTS of your life you wish you could change.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zaydana">zaydana</a>] 1-6-2009(6): The<strong> atmosphere</strong> of the wedding was pretty much ruined when it started raining over only the bride&#039;s part of the area. Picture a little raincloud over the bride.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez">Angrybeez</a>] 1-6-2008(5): <em>rain</em> ruins the <em>part</em>(y&#039;s)<strong> atmosphere</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 13-10-2009(4): (This is <strong>atmosphere</strong> as in ambiance, mood). <em>Rain</em> ruined the<strong> atmosphere</strong> of the <em>part</em>y but it was really only <em>part</em> of the problem. Bad food, bad music and boring guests were the other <em>part</em>s (thx to dingomick).
