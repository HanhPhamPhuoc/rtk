## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 29-4-2007(214): To maintain<strong> secrecy</strong>, secret societies invariably have to house themselves in the moutains. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 7-11-2007(161): To maintain<strong> secrecy</strong>, secret societies invariably have to house themselves on top of the moutains. (Slight tweak of chamcham&#039;s story, using fuaburisa&#039;s idea for remembering where to put the mountain primitive.). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 16-1-2008(53): This kanji tells you an original version of &quot;Brokeback <strong>Mountain</strong>&quot;. Here, the couple of cowboys have fallen in love, and their only way to keep their love in <strong>SECRECY</strong> is by meeting <strong>invariably</strong> at the<strong> house</strong> on the top of the <strong>mountain</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 12-4-2009(41): <strong>Secrecy</strong> in your house, invariably leads to a mountain of trouble. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 4-9-2007(17): My lover and I had a <em>house</em> in the <em>mountains</em> so that we could meet in<strong> secrecy</strong>, but it was <em>invariably</em> found out by my wife. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(15): A broken heart was kept in<strong> secrecy</strong> in a house (lodge) at the very top of the mountain. Maybe this is the broken heart of someone who would not allow others to know of their sorrow and so kept their broken heart in<strong> secrecy</strong>, far at the top of the mountain (note the position of the mountain primitive). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 22-5-2009(11): Think of a a hermit who yearns for privacy and<strong> secrecy</strong>...his <em>house</em> is <em>invariaby</em> built deep in the <em>mountains</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 17-11-2008(9): Villains suck at<strong> secrecy</strong>. Their hide-out(or <strong>house</strong>) is invariably inside the giant <strong>mountain</strong> shaped like their face. (Think Austin Powers). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 5-4-2012(8): The Berghof, Hitler&#039;s secret hideout in the Alps, is a good example: To maintain<strong> secrecy</strong> the best location for a <em>house</em> is <em>invariably</em> on top of a <em>mountain</em>...   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/秘密">秘密</a>  [ひみつ]  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/、精密">、精密</a>  [せいみつ]precise  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/、密か">、密か</a>  [ひそか] secret, private, surreptitious. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Oyabecory">Oyabecory</a>] 23-3-2013(7): Bruce Wayne (in &quot;Batman Begins&quot;) trains in<strong> secrecy</strong> with the league of shadows in a <em>house</em> at the <em>top of the mountain</em>. Ra&#039;s al Ghul believes Bruce will <em>invariably</em> join the league, but we know otherwise... I visualize Bruce Wayne going up the mountain (complete with Hans Zimmer soundtrack) for training in<strong> secrecy</strong>.
