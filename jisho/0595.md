## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia">munia</a>] 25-12-2008(60): (mature content: violence) I hung the<strong> heart</strong> of my victim with a <em>hook</em> and three <em>drops</em> of blood spattered me. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oRis1024">oRis1024</a>] 15-8-2008(30): <strong>Heart</strong> needs three drops of blood to work. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(15): Pictograph, see book. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 24-7-2007(12): こころ！. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 7-6-2006(9): When this primitive is on the left as <em>state of mind</em>, I had a hard time visualizing it. Thus I have created the following story. All the smartest people in the country were fed up with their state governments. These great <em>minds</em> joined together and created their own official <em>state</em>: the <em>state of Mind</em>. I visualize it as a small, sectioned off area with brains floating around. A scientific utopia. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fightswumbrellas">fightswumbrellas</a>] 29-5-2009(8): The big L that is surrounded by three falling water droplets symbolizes that Love occurs in the<strong> heart</strong> from beginning(left dot), middle (top dot) to end (right dot). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wizard">Wizard</a>] 24-6-2008(6): I am giving this kanji the alternative meaning <strong>&quot;Richard The Lionheart&quot;</strong> when it appears beneath a character and &quot;<strong>Jack the Ripper</strong>&quot; when it appears on the left.    (Richard is portrayed idealistically according to the movies. Jack the Ripper is portrayed as a smooth, cold killer reminiscent of Hannibal). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jbudding">jbudding</a>] 16-11-2012(5): The<strong> HEART</strong> <em>hooks</em> together the left and right limbs and the head by pumping many <em>drops</em> of blood to all 3 areas. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazurawashii">wazurawashii</a>] 7-2-2013(2): I was <em>hooked</em> on the idea of finding the 3 lost <em>Drop</em>lets of <em>Kokoro</em>. <em>Apprehension</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/疑心">疑心</a>  ,ぎしん) clouded my mind, because this was a journey no doubt filled with <em>treachery</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/異心">異心</a>  ,いしん). I <em>racked my brains</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/腐心">腐心</a>  ,ふしん) to come up with a plan, but I knew I would need to infiltrate the <em>nuclear reactor core</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/炉心">炉心</a>  ,ろしん). Unfortunately, because I was so <em>inexperienced</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/初心">初心</a>  ,うぶ) in such matters, my <em>mentality</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/心理">心理</a>  ,しんり) gave me <em>nausea</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/悪心">悪心</a>  ,おしん). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nyaaa">nyaaa</a>] 13-8-2012(2): The four chambers of the<strong> heart</strong> aren&#039;t all equal-sized.
