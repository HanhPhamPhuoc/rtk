heisig: As the key word hints, the kanji in this frame refers to the late evening or early morning hours, well after one should be in bed asleep. It does this by picturing a <i>house</i> with a <i>candle</i> in it. The reason is obvious: whoever is living there is "burning the <i>candle</i> at both ends," and working night after night into the <b>wee hours</b>.
