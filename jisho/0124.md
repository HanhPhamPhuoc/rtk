heisig: "When we think of <b>focusing</b> on something, we usually take it in a metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind. It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our <i>eye</i> on a <i>few</i> important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a <i>few</i> things and holding them before one's <i>eye</i> in order to <b>focus</b> on them better."
