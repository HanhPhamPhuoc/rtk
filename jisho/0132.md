heisig: This kanji also uses the full form of <i>water</i>, though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with <i>water</i>. Remember what William Blake said about seeing "infinity in a grain of sand and <b>eternity</b> in an hour"? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see "<b>eternity</b> in a <i>drop of water</i>."
