7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 5-2-2008(8): <strong>QUASI-</strong> and <a href="../v4/564">semi-</a> (#564 準), 準 , are closely related. Here we have a lonely<strong> Quasi-</strong>modo eating<strong> quasi-</strong>food (<em>frozen turkey</em> TV meals), and in <a href="../v4/564">semi-</a> (#564 準) we have <em>ten</em> <strong>Semi-</strong>trucks full of <em>frozen turkeys</em> on their way to the processing plant. Remember this Mnemonic: ten <strong>Semi-</strong>trucks take <em>frozen turkeys</em> to be made into food for <strong>Quasi-</strong>modo.
