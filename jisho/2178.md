## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 8-5-2007(28): He came to finding himself down at the <strong>wharf</strong> with <em>soil</em> all over his tuxedo. The <em>maestro</em> can only guess that he&#039;d been drugged by some <em>needle</em> sharp dart, since the last thing that he recalled was feeling a prick on the bottom, before waking up at the <strong>wharf</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(21): Note: Right side 阜 is <a href="../2928">large hill</a> (#2928 阜).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 12-5-2009(17): If you build a<strong> wharf</strong> on a <em><a href="../2928">large hill</a> (#2928 阜)</em>, the vessels should be able to sail the <em>soil</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 29-8-2010(12): You idiot! Why on earth did you build the<strong> wharf</strong> on a large hill? Are the ships supposed to sail through the dirt to get there? That is seriously the WORST place you could have built it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 8-9-2010(5): This was once a <a href="../2928">large hill</a> (#2928 阜) before the <em>soil</em> was removed to create a<strong> wharf</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(5): The <em>Black Mages</em> (<em>ten maestros</em>) wait on the <em>soil</em> of the<strong> wharf</strong> to embark on their international tour.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 21-6-2008(3): The oldest<strong> WHARF</strong> was just a small bit of SOIL. Then they began using LARGE HILLS , which helped boats supply and resupply. Now, we just build the<strong> WHARF</strong>S instead of using DIRT or LARGE HILLS.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dalmim">dalmim</a>] 26-10-2011(1): <em>Soil</em> formed the Ceuta<strong> WHARF</strong> that extends from the city, above which a <em>large hill</em> rises. <a href="http://www.sotogrande-spain.com/images/ceuta3.jpg">http://www.sotogrande-spain.com/images/ceuta3.jpg</a>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 6-3-2010(1): This was once a <em><a href="../2928">large hill</a> (#2928 阜)</em> before the <em>soil</em> was removed to create a<strong> wharf</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 31-10-2009(1): A WARF is SOIL piled up like a LARGE HILL ( 阜 FRAME 2928) in the water. We just see and walk on the top of it. (Thanks Katsuo).
