heisig: After seeing a constant <b>horizon</b> of <i>water</i>, <i>water</i> everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the <i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i> of land on a new <b>horizon</b>? Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact <i>ivy</i>, but the phrase "<i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i>" has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details.
