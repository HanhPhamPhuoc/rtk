## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(234): Nobody likes the<strong> tax</strong> man, so here it is only fitting that the person who comes over to take some of your <em>wheat</em> is depicted here as a devil. Keep in mind that in feudal societies there was no kind of money to speak of, so<strong> tax</strong>es were paid by serfs in <em>wheat</em> to the <em>devils</em> who came over to keep them poor.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 11-1-2008(98): This is an easy one.<strong> Tax</strong>es is like the devil taking away your hard earned wheat.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 22-7-2007(21): I don&#039;t know if it makes sense, but it works for me: If the Warrior cannot levy the shells [frame 378], then the Devil will come and colllect your Wheat as<strong> Tax</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 20-4-2008(11): &quot;No, mister<strong> tax</strong> man, please no! Anything but this! Please don&#039;t take our <em>bread</em> away! how shall I feed my <em>horny teenager</em> now?&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 21-12-2008(9): When the church takes 10% of your <em>wheat</em> harvest, it&#039;s a tithe. When the <em>devil</em> takes it, it&#039;s a<strong> tax</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 18-12-2007(9): &quot;Yes I&#039;m the<strong> tax</strong>man, If you take a walk I&#039;ll<strong> tax</strong> your feet, If try to eat I&#039;ll<strong> tax</strong> the wheat...taxman!!&quot; What a devil, that<strong> tax</strong>man is - If you don&#039;t get the reference listen to the song &quot;Taxman&quot; by The Beatles.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 16-9-2008(6): The <em>wheaties</em> company marketed their cereal as pornography in order to avoid food <strong>taxes</strong>, it sure got the attention of <em>horny teenagers</em>. <a href="http://users.on.net/">http://users.on.net/</a>~drneale/tax.jpg.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 22-4-2012(4): A<strong> tax</strong> is like your best <em>wheat</em> crop being taken away by the <em>devil</em>. (Note that a <a href="../81">tribute</a> (#81 貢) is generally given to show esteem or gratitude, a <a href="../378">levy</a> (#378 賦) is a charge, a <a href="../884">duty</a> (#884 役) is an obligation and not not just an import <a href="../1778">tariff</a> (#1778 租), and a real <a href="../895">tax</a> (#895 税) is the work of the <em>devil</em>, the right primitive of the kanji).
