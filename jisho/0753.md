## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 19-8-2008(293): Sexual<strong> climax</strong>es don&#039;t always happen on the bed; they sometimes happen against a wall or on the ground! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 28-4-2006(134): The<strong> climax</strong> of the Berlin Wall affair was the tearing of it to ground. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rosgmact">rosgmact</a>] 13-8-2007(44): The Biblical Onan was condemned for his solo<strong> climax</strong>. Working ONE ELBOW furiously, he spilled his seed on the GROUND, and God was angry at his selfishness and wastefulness. (Perhaps the greatest punishment is that his name has been synonymous with such solitary pursuits throughout the ages since.). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/playadom">playadom</a>] 6-12-2008(29): He<strong> climax</strong>ed so hard, it spurted up on to the wall, and he soiled his pants in the process. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 19-9-2007(24): You put bags of<em> soil</em> against the bedroom <em>wall</em> to drown out the neighbour&#039;s <em>climax</em> noises. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 11-6-2008(17): This kanji is the companion to <a href="../686">from</a> <span class="index">(#686 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/乃">乃</a>)</span>. It carries the primary meaning of &#039;arrive&#039; or &#039;reach&#039;, so the   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/乃至">乃至</a>   compound means &quot;<em>from... to...</em>&quot;. In this sense, it is logical how humanity has progressed from using <em>soil</em> to build shelter, etc., to making <em>walls</em> and more advanced structures. And yet, we have not reached the<strong> CLIMAX</strong> of our potential. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 26-3-2008(16): <strong>Climax</strong> so hard that you soil the wall. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-10-2005(12): A zen meditator reaches a<strong> climax</strong> of concentration, facing a <em>wall</em>, <em>grounded</em> in the Lotus posture (the purpose of the meditation posture is to lower one&#039;s center of gravity nearer to the <em>ground</em>, to be very stable, and to allow sitting for very long periods of time). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/isharabash">isharabash</a>] 19-9-2009(10): The<strong> climax</strong> of humpty dumpty? when he falls off the wall and hits the dirt. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Satchmobgw">Satchmobgw</a>] 12-6-2010(8): People often say the<strong> CLIMAX</strong> of the story is when the &quot;shit hits the fan&quot;, but I think it&#039;s more polite to say when the &quot;dirt hits the wall&quot;.
