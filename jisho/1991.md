2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 8-8-2008(91): In -my-<strong> home country</strong>, we&#039;d like to put up <em>walls</em> to keep <em>Bush</em> -OUT-, thank you very much.

To the northern border you have it protected by BUSHES, while to south you have it protected by CITY WALLS (or a 800 mile long fence).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/QuackingShoe">QuackingShoe</a>] 22-7-2008(30): In my<strong> home country</strong>, all we had for <em>city walls</em> was <em>bushes!</em>.

See <a href="../1841">residence</a> (#1841 邸) - thanks scotty28) A nostalgic immigrant to the <em>slums</em> reminisces: &quot;In the <strong>home country</strong>, we were surrounded by pretty <em>bushes</em>, not ugly <em>slums</em>&quot;.

I&#039;m sure he&#039;d love to fence up the whole coastline with huge <em>city walls</em> to keep intruders out (much like the Great Wall of China once did).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kuma01">Kuma01</a>] 17-3-2011(5): In the<strong> home country</strong> of the elves the city walls are formed by giant bushes.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 26-7-2009(5): Blah blah blah <em>Bush</em> this, Obama that- shut up. I&#039;m just going to create my own<strong> home country</strong> surrounded by an impenetrable <em>city wall</em> to keep all the annoying idiots out.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>] 25-7-2009(5): George <em>Bush</em> and <em>Mister Burns</em> are from the same<strong> home country</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 31-1-2010(4): In my<strong> home country</strong> <em>bushes</em> often grow out of cracks in the <em>city walls</em>. HINT: To remember that vertical stroke of 丰 curves: When something grows out of a vertical wall, the stem bends upward as soon as it can.
