heisig: Take <b>inscription</b> in the sense of the <i>name</i> you ask the jeweler to carve on a <i>gold</i> bracelet or inside a <i>gold</i> ring to identify its owner or communicate some sentimental message. It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time.
