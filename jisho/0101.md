heisig: Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for <i>woman</i> in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a <b>mama</b>. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups.
