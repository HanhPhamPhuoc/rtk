1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 3-8-2007(326): You&#039;re at a restaurant and raise your <em>finger</em> to indicate to the waiter that you want to<strong> pay</strong>. Your friend <em>elbows</em> you in the ribs -- it&#039;s his shout, and he insists on taking care of the bill.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stazor">stazor</a>] 27-8-2010(26): Traditionally Japanese people kept vallet in their kimono sleeves, so they reach for elbow with their fingers when they want to<strong> pay</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 12-9-2008(24): As if making people<strong> pay</strong> with their <em>fingers</em> is bad enough, the Yakuza now accept <em>elbows</em> as a form of<strong> pay</strong>ment..... :-p.
