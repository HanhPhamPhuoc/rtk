## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 26-10-2006(227): If you just grow your christmas tree in a well, there will be no need to<strong> till</strong> the soil.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 17-11-2007(78): A man was<strong> till</strong>ing a new plot to plant <em>xmas trees</em> but his tractor hit an old covered-up <em>well</em> and fell halfway in, he&#039;s asking for a new tractor for xmas..

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 19-12-2007(51): Note:<strong> till</strong> in the sense of plow or cultivate, not until. (story: ergerg).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 21-12-2007(31): Plant a <em>Christmas tree</em> to mark the location of the <em>well</em>, so that those who are<strong> till</strong>ing the soil won&#039;t fall in.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 7-7-2008(15): I kept drawing a complete blank every time this Kanji would come up, so I started thinking of the phrase &quot;don&#039;t open<strong> till</strong> Xmas&quot; that you often see on Christmas presents in cartoons and things. This brought the image of the Christmas tree to my mind, and from there I could use one of the other stories.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 17-6-2009(13): &quot;Don&#039;t open<strong> till</strong> <em>Christmas</em>.&quot; &quot;But I want it now!&quot; &quot;<em>Well</em>, too bad. You&#039;ll have to wait.&quot; &quot;I don&#039;t want to wait<strong> till</strong> <em>Christmas</em>!&quot; &quot;<em>Well</em>, get over it. You have to.&quot; (I know this kanji means<strong> till</strong> in the sense of<strong> till</strong>ing soil, but it&#039;s easier for me to remember this way).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mylriahd">Mylriahd</a>] 6-4-2010(11): A cheap way to<strong> till</strong> the soil: drag a <em>Christmas tree</em> behind you, just be sure to avoid the <em>well</em> or you&#039;ll lose your tree.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 3-8-2009(8): The tree farmer<strong> till</strong>s the soil to plant a crop of <em>Christmas trees</em> near a <em>well</em> for easy watering.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 20-6-2007(7): Those who<strong> till</strong> the soil also cut their own Xmas trees and get water from wells. The rest of us have to go the shop or turn on a tap.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asayoru">Asayoru</a>] 7-11-2010(3): I<strong> till</strong> the soil for planting my <em>Christmas tree</em>s near the <em>well</em> so it will be easy to water them.
