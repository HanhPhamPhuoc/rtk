## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 7-6-2007(157): I have a <em>funnel</em> attached to my laptop that takes my prof&#039;s<strong> lecture</strong> and puts the <em>words</em> into a text file. The bigger the funnel, the more accurate the conversion, so picture a bunch of laptops with large, unwieldy funnels attached to the USB port.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-3-2007(101): Image: a professor walking around with a <em>funnel</em> and simply pouring his <em>words</em> into each students head instead of a <strong>lecture</strong>. (Primitive: <em>FUNNEL</em>, who got the <em>celery</em> stuck in the funnel <em>again</em>?! You know it&#039;s not supposed to be used for that!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tenricefieldsglue">tenricefieldsglue</a>] 7-7-2009(63): FUNNEL primitive: &quot;<em>Celery--again</em>?!&quot; &quot;You&#039;ll eat your <em>celery</em> or else I&#039;ll make you eat it with a FUNNEL!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 14-5-2010(39): At a<strong> lecture</strong> <em>words</em> are <em>funneled</em> into students.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-7-2007(15): <em>Socrates</em> is giving a<strong> lecture</strong>. He&#039;s using a <em>funnel</em> as a megaphone but also pours some celery in there between words. // Primitive: <em>funnel</em> = who got the <em>celery</em> stuck in the funnel <em>again</em>?!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 14-10-2006(15): The professor is giving a<strong> lecture</strong> in such a big<strong> lecture</strong> hall, that he speaks into a funnel so that his words will be audible.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gheymen">gheymen</a>] 14-4-2009(14): Sorry, but theres nothing that you can say or do to convince me that this is a funnel. Celery Again = Sick of. Words that i&#039;m sick of =<strong> Lecture</strong>s. Simple.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 12-4-2008(11): For <strong>funnel</strong>: You start liquefying <em>celery</em> and guzzling it down with a <strong>funnel</strong> to avoid having your <em>jeweled belt</em> adjusted yet <em>again</em>.....

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Median">Median</a>] 16-8-2012(5): [Primitive: Again + Celery = Diet (Once again, I am eating celery, since I am on a diet.)] With my diet, I don&#039;t have enough energy to remember the words said at the<strong> lecture</strong> by the<strong> lecture</strong>r. KOUshi | KOUshuu.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-7-2009(5): I don&#039;t like <em>celery</em>, but I&#039;m told the same <em>words</em> <em>again</em> and <em>again</em> as I&#039;m<strong> lecture</strong>d on how healthy it is.
