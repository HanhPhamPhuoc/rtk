## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-3-2007(190): &quot;Don&#039;t be <strong>foolish</strong>!&quot; says <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> as he lashes you with his belt. Follow logic, like me, not your <em>heart</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 20-3-2007(39): I simply imagine <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> jumping all over the place, like a mad man, yelling &quot;yeeeeehaaaaa!&quot;. Maybe he just fell in love? Mnemonic - &quot;<em>Jiminy Cricket</em> has a<strong> foolish</strong> <em>heart</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/redskatz">redskatz</a>] 8-4-2009(31): It&#039;d be <strong>foolish</strong> to follow <em>Jiminy Cricket&#039;s</em> advice in matters of the <em>heart</em>. After all, you never see him around any girl crickets, do you?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/busaiku">busaiku</a>] 7-1-2010(11): &quot;Do you think I&#039;ll ever have an <em>heart</em> like a real child&quot; asks Pinoccio to <em>Jiminy Cricket</em>. In an unexpected reaction, he laughs at him:&quot;My dear child, that&#039;s the<strong> foolish</strong> thing I ever heard&quot;. Boy, those old fairy tales sure were crude.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 2-5-2009(10): I know you think it was<strong> foolish</strong> of me to give my <em>heart</em> to a <em>long tailed monkey</em> 禺, but we have a healthy relationship based on mutual love and trust! ... Okay, maybe we&#039;re both just idiots.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 9-2-2010(5): Even <em>Jiminy</em> is a <strong>fool</strong> over affairs of the <em>heart</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jcdietz03">jcdietz03</a>] 6-3-2010(4): <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> knows deep down in his <a href="../595">heart</a> (#595 心) that it is<strong> foolish</strong> to try to help humans, because they will just squash him.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 5-3-2008(4): <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> on his indulgent road-show<strong> foolish</strong>ly fell for one of the groupies and poured out his <em>heart</em>, but she was just after his wallet and robbed him blind while he slept.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 6-1-2008(4): Pinoccio was being<strong> foolish</strong> so Jiminy ripped out his heart and stomped on it (hence he is on top of it). &quot;Now I&#039;ll be your concious. Don&#039;t be<strong> foolish</strong> and do what I say!&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 16-12-2009(3): Ah the<strong> foolish</strong> <em>heart</em> of <em>Jiminy Cricket</em>.
