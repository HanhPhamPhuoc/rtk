heisig: "The sense of <b>little</b> that this character represents is not the same as &quot;a little bit.&quot; That meaning comes in the next frame. Here <b>little</b> means &quot;small&quot; or &quot;tiny.&quot; The image is one of three <b>little</b> <i>drops</i>, the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: <b>little</b>, <b>little</b>, nothing but <b>little</b>. The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards like this: 0. SIMPLE 3 little drops."
