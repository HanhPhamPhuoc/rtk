## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 13-6-2007(250): &quot;Ranger! I want you to go check the<strong> status</strong> of each tree.&quot; &quot;Errr, Each tree sir?&quot; replies the ranger looking out over the vast forest. &quot;That&#039;s Right, I want the<strong> status</strong> of each tree! Move out!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 22-10-2010(80): A man measures his own <strong>status</strong> by the size of his <em>wood</em>y...and compares it to <em>each</em> one he sees. 性格 (せいかく) : character, personality; 合格 (ごうかく) : success, passing (e.g. exam), eligibility.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 11-12-2007(73): I find I need a more concrete image for this. EACH TREE has it&#039;s own<strong> STATUS</strong>. For example, the Christmas Tree is holy, the Willow is of high class while the lowly Bonsai is of low class.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 14-5-2006(32): A person looking for <strong>status</strong> wants a <em>tree</em> of <em>each</em> kind in his garden.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 11-1-2008(26): (カク, コウ) In Japan, where land is so precious, <em>each tree</em> you have helps elevate your<strong> status</strong> in society. Unless you are Kumi KOUda and can actually afford to buy lots of trees, the only way you will get them is if you KAKU them.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 12-11-2007(14): A <em>tree</em> of <em>each</em> kind in your garden =<strong> Status</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(10): The annoying <em>tree</em> keeps posting a new Facebook-<strong>status</strong> <em>each</em> day. I&#039;m seriously gonna remove him from my news feed soon.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jshield1">jshield1</a>] 22-4-2009(6): <strong>Status</strong> is something we wood each like.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vichango">vichango</a>] 13-4-2009(6): If only the world would grow a <em>tree</em> <em>each</em> time someone updates its <strong>status</strong> on facebook.
