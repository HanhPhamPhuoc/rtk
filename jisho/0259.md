heisig: "Do not think of a &quot;gift&quot; here, but of the <b>present</b> moment, as distinct from the future and the past. The kanji gives us a <i>ball</i> in which we see the <b>present</b>&nbsp;- obviously a crystal <i>ball</i> that enables us to <i>see</i> things going on at the <b>present</b> in faraway places."
