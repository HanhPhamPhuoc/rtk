heisig: The kanji connoting rank or class shows us a new element on the left: the familiar primitive for <i>staples</i> with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke. It is easiest in these cases to make a primitive related to what we already know. Hence, we call it a <i>staple gun</i>. To the right, <i>missile</i>.
