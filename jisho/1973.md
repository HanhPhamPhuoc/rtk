3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-7-2007(55): Word play to differentiate<strong> elude</strong>/evade:<strong> elude</strong> ~= e-lewd.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 20-2-2007(36): I like to maintain the primitive as <strong>excuse</strong>. Here a speedster is caught trying to<strong> elude</strong> the police. He stands outside his car bowing over and over saying   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/ご免なさい、ご免なさい、ご免なさい。">ご免なさい、ご免なさい、ご免なさい。</a>   | Note: I&#039;ve actually witnessed this very event happening here in Japan. It is a common thing that people here will do when &quot;caught&quot; by the police...you&#039;ll see them sometimes bowing furiously apologizing over and over for their &quot;bad&quot; behavior.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 16-9-2009(10): The <em>rabbit</em> <strong>deviated</strong> from its path and crossed the <em>road</em>. It ended in a drama: It was hit by a car. When the driver realized it, he got out of the car and <em>excused</em> himself: &quot;I am so so sorry! Are you okay?&quot; (careful: <a href="../2416">elude</a> <span class="index">(#2416 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/遁">遁</a>)</span>. You should probably use <strong>deviate</strong>).
