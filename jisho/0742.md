## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 17-7-2006(363): This character is the &quot;kei&quot; in &quot;keitai&quot; (cell phone), a word you will no doubt hear often in Japan, since everyone has one. Imagine you&#039;ve just arrived in Japan, but don&#039;t have a cell phone yet, so instead you&#039;re carrying around a<strong> portable</strong> turkey you can hold in your fist. To dial a number, just poke it with your fingers.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 5-4-2007(116): Because they have no <em>fingers</em>, <em>turkeys</em> must use their <em>fists</em> when dialing on a<strong> portable</strong> phone.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 22-6-2009(36): This character is the &quot;kei&quot; in &quot;keitai&quot; (cell phone), a word you will no doubt hear often in Japan, since everyone has one. I use my keitai with my FINGERS, like everyone, but if some TURKEY try to steal it, I don&#039;t hesitate to use my FIST .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 8-8-2006(19): Some TURKEY has been sitting in the<strong> PORTABLE</strong> toilet forever. I pound my FIST on the door. Finally he comes out and gives me the FINGER.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terebijoke">terebijoke</a>] 16-2-2012(16): What do you do with your <strong>portable</strong> keitai? Play ANGRY BIRDS, of course! You use you <strong>fingers</strong> to drag the birds across the screen. How do you know these birds are angry? Just picture a <strong>turkey</strong> scowling and shaking his <strong>fist</strong> at you.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vinniram">vinniram</a>] 19-6-2010(9): I FINGER and FIST my<strong> PORTABLE</strong> TURKEY sex doll.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 16-12-2007(7): This is the<strong> portable</strong> TURKEY phone. You hold it by making a FIST and sticking your thumb up its ass, and operate it with the FINGERS of the other hand.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dsamari">dsamari</a>] 18-11-2007(7): Now, with new and amazing<strong> portable</strong> phones, that are so small that it looks like you are talking to your fist, but you will look like a turkey when trying to press the keys.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dorban">dorban</a>] 20-8-2012(5): This character is the &quot;kei&quot; in &quot;keitai&quot; (cell phone). But instead of phone you use a<strong> portable</strong> <em>turkey</em> (do you see the buttons in turkey kanji?). To dial a number, you use <em>fingers</em> as usual, but as turkeys are disobedient, you need to hit it with your <em>fist</em> from time to time. (thank stormchild).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/battlehymnz">battlehymnz</a>] 2-1-2011(5): Try these new <em>Turkey</em> <em>Fingers</em>! The<strong> portable</strong> snack for anyone on the go! You can purchase a <em>fist</em>ful <em>from</em> Quik-E-Mart for $0.99.
