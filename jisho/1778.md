## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/felicitygreen">felicitygreen</a>] 27-4-2006(206): The EU and US impose such high<strong> tariff</strong>s on food imports that third world <em>wheat</em> (the most basic of staples) never reaches first world supermarket <em>shelves</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 6-8-2006(134): According to Henshall, this kanji originally represented the harvested rice (the wheat primitive) that farmers paid as a tithe. Its meaning today would seem to be very similar. Imagine the farmer putting aside some of his harvested <em>wheat</em> on a <em>shelf</em> in order to pay the<strong> tariff</strong> to his lord. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-3-2007(29): All the <em>wheat</em> imports sit on a <em>shelf</em> until the <strong>tariff</strong> is paid and it can be distributed. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-3-2008(24): Tax. (Heisig is trying to hard to come up with different words) The devil who has collected wheat taxes before, stores these taxes in shelves. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/firion1234">firion1234</a>] 18-3-2010(5): &quot;If <em>WHEAT</em> you&#039;d like to eat,&quot; said the <em>CAT IN THE HAT</em>, &quot;then you&#039;ll have to pay the sheriff a<strong> TARIFF</strong>.&quot;. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Schwingy">Schwingy</a>] 20-5-2009(3): To avoid using the word TAX twice, I decided to use the word TAXATION which lead me to &quot;Taxation without Representation&quot;. The Government has started putting outrageous taxes on Wheaties (my primitive). Pull the Wheaties off the shelves and throw it in to Harbor! Take that, Taxation! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 20-6-2011(2): The <em>devil</em> takes half of my <em>wheat</em> for taxes, so I have to hid the rest of the <em>wheat</em> in my <em>file cabinet</em> to pay for my<strong> tariff</strong>s. It is filed under P for poor :(.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/租税">租税</a>   【そぜい】 (n) taxes; taxation Don&#039;t mix up with <a href="../895">tax</a> <span class="index">(#895 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/税">税</a>)</span>, <a href="../378">levy</a> <span class="index">(#378 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/賦">賦</a>)</span>.
