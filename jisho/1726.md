## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-9-2007(205): When sitting <strong>vis-a-vis</strong>, <em>Scots</em> will <em>glue</em> their <em>kilt</em> down to avoid embaressment. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laxxy">laxxy</a>] 8-10-2006(81): This is a character that is used in Japanese for &quot;vs.&quot; (as in, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 2-6-2006(45): This isn&#039;t plaid, it&#039;s tophat and sheaf. In the tophatted wheat cutting competition, one contestant gathered more sheafs than anyone else, he had an advantage<strong> vis-a-vis</strong> the rest because he had glued his tophat on, everyone else&#039;s hat kept coming off. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 8-4-2007(33): The word<strong> vis-a-vis</strong> is like <em>sentence glue</em>, it kind of joins sentences together. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/netsplitter">netsplitter</a>] 15-12-2008(21): <em>Wolverine</em> has to <em>glue</em> a <em>top hat</em> to his head when sitting<strong> vis-a-vis</strong> on a train so no one recognizes him. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 12-11-2010(14): Think of this as <strong>vs</strong> rather than<strong> vis-a-vis</strong>. Story: take any two words, <em>glue</em> them together with this kanji, and you have a complete <em>sentence</em>! E.g. &quot;alien vs predator&quot;, &quot;plants vs zombies&quot; etc. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez">Angrybeez</a>] 17-8-2008(14): Think Train Spotting. Two Scotsmen sniffing glue together get stuck together face to face. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 2-8-2007(11): Two people&#039;s <em>plaids</em> are <em>glued</em> together making them stand face-to-face. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 30-6-2009(8): Sentences are glued together<strong> vis-a-vis</strong> to make a story. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 23-2-2008(7):   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/対する">対する</a>   【たいする】 (vs-s) to face; to confront; to oppose; (P) STORY: Remember that mean teacher in a TOP HAT that put all those バツ&#039;s on the SENTENCES in your essay? Well you GLUE some tacks to her chair to OPPOSE her. Teacher VS. student.
