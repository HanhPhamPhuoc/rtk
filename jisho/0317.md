heisig: "Look more closely at your <i>lidded crock</i> and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge. This is so you can use it to calculate the <b>circumference</b> of your <i>motorcycle helmet</i>: just begin at a fixed point and turn the <i>lidded crock</i> around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the <i>helmet</i>, until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your <i>lidded crock</i> made, you now know the <b>circumference</b>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hanako1975">hanako1975</a>] 8-1-2008(188): If my LIDDED CROCK has the same<strong> CIRCUMFERENCE</strong> as my head, I like to use it as a HELMET. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer">mdspencer</a>] 3-4-2009(47): When the <em>ground</em> has an <em>opening</em> (a hole), you need to cover the entire<strong> circumference</strong> or you will fall in. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 20-8-2007(36): You&#039;re at a motorcycle store looking to buy a helmet. The only way to check the<strong> circumference</strong> of your head is to put increasingly larger lidded crocks on your head until one slips on just right. Now you know what size helmet to buy. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 10-11-2008(16): The<strong> CIRCUMFERENCE</strong> of the Earth&#039;s soil <em>surface</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/土">土</a>  ) has been the <em>same</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/同">同</a>  ) for a long time. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 29-12-2007(15): There&#039;s a <em>hole</em> (mouth) in the <em>ground</em>, so the men at work have put a <em>barrier tape</em> (hood) forming a circunference, to prevent people from falling into it. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lightning31">lightning31</a>] 23-7-2010(12): Throwing off his hood to reveal a helmet made from a lidded crock, the man roared, &quot;I am Sir Cumference!&quot;. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 29-9-2008(8): I use 冂 to mean a <em>measuring tape</em> that is laid around something to measure it. I lay a <em>measuring tape</em> around a round <em>lidded crook</em> to measure its<strong> circumference</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aboros">aboros</a>] 3-10-2006(8): The tea cozy (<em>hood</em>) hugs tight to the complete<strong> circumference</strong> of the <em>lidded crock</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 15-6-2009(6): Picture this: You put on a HELMET, you are magically minituarized, and begin to run laps around the<strong> CIRCUMFERENCE</strong> of the lidded crock. (this helps you remember both the kanji and the primitive, yey~!). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 13-8-2010(4):   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/一周">一周</a>   <a href="../317">circumference</a> <span class="index">(#317 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/周">周</a>)</span> シュウ, まわり ...

Note: Even though Heisig does not make the distinction, it is worth pointing that this is not the same shape as 冂. This character is built from 勹. It has come to look a lot like 冂, but the first stroke is rather different, especially in handwriting. ...   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/熟語">熟語</a>  : ... cf:   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/径">径</a>   <a href="../882">diameter</a> <span class="index">(#882 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/径">径</a>)</span>.
