3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 22-3-2009(61): (Think rpg!) We were in dire need of<strong> healing</strong>. Our party was fighting the <em>cavemen</em>, but we didn&#039;t fare too well. It was more like a <em>butcher&#039;s meeting</em> than a fight... just as they were about to pierce my <em>heart</em>, luckily a priest came along and used his<strong> healing</strong> spell <a href="../v4/2433">in the nick of time</a> (#2433 愈).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-7-2009(31): <strong>Healing</strong> from <em>sickness</em> often comes just <a href="../v4/2433">in the nick of time</a> (#2433 愈), especially during boss battles.
