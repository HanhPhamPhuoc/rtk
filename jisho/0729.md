## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 15-5-2007(218): My <em>stones</em> are so huge that it takes <em>two hands</em> to<strong> polish</strong> them!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 30-1-2007(184): You use two hands to<strong> polish</strong> a stone: one to hold it and the other to rub it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazzab">wazzab</a>] 18-2-2007(37): Scene from Karate Kid: Wax on (with one hand), wax off (with the other). But instead of using cloth he&#039;s using stones in his hand.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(23): Cinderella <strong>polishing</strong> the <em>stone</em> floor with <em>both hands</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 6-3-2010(15): To<strong> polish</strong> a katana you need two things: finest grade of <strong>polishing</strong> <em>stones</em>, and of course <em>two hands</em>. If you accidentally chop one off, your career as sword<strong> polish</strong>er is over. (once again I&#039;m using this to remember the order of the elements - first stone, then two hands).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vanirra">vanirra</a>] 8-10-2009(8): The connotation of &quot;polish&quot; here is as in refining skills;<strong> polish</strong>ing your skills; etc... So for a story, think more like<strong> polish</strong>ing you <em>hands</em> (with an abstract <em>stone</em> of knowledge). But this kanji is for the most part just used in けんきゅう [ 研究 ] (n, vs) study, research, investigation. -- けん = sharpen (i.e., case study); きゅう = ~seek (i.e., more (info))--.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 12-12-2007(7): Imagine a novice monk crouched and running back and forth with his <em>two hands</em> together holding a cloth,<strong> polish</strong>ing the <em>stone</em> temple floor before them.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yawfosu88">yawfosu88</a>] 5-4-2008(6): NOTE: KARATE KID will be my primitive for two hands, due to the wax on wax off scene, thanks wazzab.-------- Imagine <em>Karate Kid</em> being forced by Mr. Miyagi to<strong> polish</strong> <em>stone</em> with his bare two hands. &quot;Go on Daniel- san!<strong> Polish</strong> it good! I want it to sparkle!&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 10-6-2007(6): <strong>Polish</strong> = <em>Stoned Castro</em>. [I am using Castro for &quot;two hands&quot;, because of his famous gesture with the two hands holding one another over the head]. <em>Castro</em> gets <em>stoned</em> and decides that he is<strong> Polish</strong>, not Cuban.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Centraal">Centraal</a>] 1-2-2009(5): Fred Flintstone<strong> polish</strong>es his stone bowling ball with two hands.
