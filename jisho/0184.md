heisig: "Above we see the primitive for <i>little</i> attached to one of those <i>glass canopies</i> you might use to display a family heirloom. The <i>littleness</i> is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted <i>mouth</i> of an <b>esteemed</b> ancestor. We may be used to <b>esteeming</b> the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also <b>esteem</b> the very <i>mouth</i> that spoke them. I leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece."
