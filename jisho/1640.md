Words . . . acorn.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 16-5-2007(231): I asked my teacher what this strange <em>word</em> meant, and she furiously replied that it was explained in the<strong> above-stated</strong> paragraph before throwing an <em>acorn</em> at me!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 5-2-2007(99): The<strong> above-stated</strong> <em>words</em> are the <em>acorn</em> from which the following statement grows.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 24-7-2008(79): I literally imagined atree with <em>words</em> stuck on <em>acorns</em>. And thus the <em>words</em> are<strong> above-stated</strong> (that is until they fall on your head I guess). (This one really needs a mental picture).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow">cornrow</a>] 16-12-2008(26): <strong>ABOVE-STATED</strong> is a synonym with ACORNmentioned. I mean &quot;aforementioned&quot;. Really easy to remember if you just think of ACORNmentioned.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 10-2-2008(12): You, a hog, just asked what the word means. Socrates answers:&#039;The meaning of this word is stated above&#039; &#039;yes, but I don&#039;t understand the kanji.&#039; S:&#039;Well it is stated above&#039; &#039; I just told you that I dont understand it.&#039; S:&#039;The word is stated above&#039;&#039;Yes but...&#039; S:&#039; You dum hog, stated above is the word&#039;... this could go on for a while as the kanji you are pointing to is 該 .

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thedudeman76">thedudeman76</a>] 14-4-2010(11): Could you please summarize the<strong> above-stated</strong> words in a nutshell? Better yet, as many words as you can fit in this acorn...

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 27-1-2009(10): Nobody ever reads contracts carefully enough. You could come right out and put, &quot;The <strong>above-stated</strong> <em>words</em> are nuttier than an <em>acorn</em>, and so are you if you sign this,&quot; and people would sign it anyway.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 15-2-2010(5): Obama finishing up a speech: &quot;...and all the<strong> above-stated</strong> <em>words</em> were written by <em>ACORN</em> who is helping me take over the world for socialism. Hey, I didn&#039;t put that in there! Has Sarah Palin been screwing with my teleprompter again?&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 4-2-2008(5): 該 【がい】 (pref) said; matter in question. 該当 【がいとう】 (n,vs) corresponding; answering to; coming under; applying to; (P) STORY: THE MATTER IN QUESTION is whether or not HOGS can SPEAK WORDS. If not, it&#039;s OK to eat them. Sorry Babe.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/faneca">faneca</a>] 15-3-2012(3): <strong>NOTE FOR USERS OF THE SPANISH EDITION</strong>: Bernabé and Calafell (the best Japanese to Spanish translators I&#039;ve ever seen) have done an impeccable work adapting Heisig so far (except for <a href="../v4/1215">destitution</a> (#1215 乏)). This is the second time I disagree with them, although this time they aren&#039;t wrong at all; but I wonder why they choose the two-worded, extremely long expression &quot;<strong>mencionado anteriormente</strong>&quot; (literally &quot;previously mentioned&quot;) when there is a word that expresses exactly that: &quot;<strong>susodicho</strong>&quot;.
