A man hands over his <em>money</em> to the girl and then <em>stands up</em>, and she then opens up her <em>mouth</em> to <strong>compensate</strong> him. If that girl&#039;s parents want to fix her problem, they are going to need to put a <em>muzzle</em> on her!

The only problem was, I had to wear it clipping my mouth shut, to <em>muzzle</em> me from spreading bad publicity. It&#039;s so heavy the bottom of my face is stretching.
