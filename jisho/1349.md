## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 9-10-2007(170): Before giving your<strong> SIGNATURE</strong> to accept the LOVEDOLL, you should EYE over the LOVEDOLL for any damages, then give your<strong> SIGNATURE</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 22-9-2006(29): [signature; govt office; police station] <strong>Signature</strong>? Forget it! Retina scanners (using our <em>eyes</em> as <strong>signature</strong>) will empower governments to find <em>someone</em> in any <em>soil</em>, any <em>day</em>, rendering all of us like <em>puppets</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 29-7-2006(22): The character also means &quot;public-service office or station&quot; (tax office, police station, ...). I&#039;ll use this to distinguish the kanji from other keywords like &quot;inscription&quot; that suggest a written name. Here I have a public-service station where residents can get a new<strong> signature</strong>, in calligraphy form. There are two sizes : big and small. The big one is made by the <em>cyclops</em>, and the small one by the <em>puppet</em>. So that&#039;s where you find this unlikely duo: at the<strong> signature</strong> public-service station.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 5-1-2010(6): <em>Chucky</em> has a phobia of pens so his<strong> signature</strong> is unique. He pokes someone&#039;s <em>eye</em> out and uses the flowing blood to write &quot;Chucky&quot; I wonder if the mortgage agency will find that<strong> signature</strong> acceptable.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 30-1-2010(5): The banker keeps an <em>eye</em> on you when you put your<strong> signature</strong> to the document to make sure you&#039;re the <em>someone</em> you say you are.
