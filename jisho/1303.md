## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 4-11-2007(201): To distinguish between 否 <strong> negate</strong>, and 不 <a href="../v4/1217">negative</a> (#1217 不): Note that ne<em>gate</em> contains 口 , which is a kind of gate.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mairov">mairov</a>] 2-1-2008(143): Negative mouths<strong> negate</strong> everything.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 10-9-2007(48): I get this mixed up with <a href="../v4/1217">negative</a> (#1217 不). The difference here is that someone <strong>ate</strong> the <em>negative</em> to<strong> negate</strong> it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 5-1-2007(31): Tip: this is much better learned as &quot;SAY NO&quot;, negation coming out of a mouth, easy to remember if you have kids.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/unauthorized">unauthorized</a>] 27-12-2009(24): Hint: This is the old kanji writing of the word &quot;<strong>いいえ</strong>&quot; (no), which is a negative word coming out of your mouth. Using the Japanese meaning as keyword helps avoid confusion with <a href="../v4/1217">negative</a> (#1217 不).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 27-11-2008(11): The girl that you are chasing<strong> negate</strong>d your advances toward her. She said &quot;That&#039;s a <em>negative</em>. I am <em>NOT</em> putting that in my <em>mouth</em>!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saizen">saizen</a>] 5-8-2008(9): Taken from (Frame 1217) Story: <em>Mr. T</em> obviously didn&#039;t know who he was messing with cause when he spit at his capturer, the capturer opened his <em>mouth</em> and swallowed it completely <strong>negate</strong>ing his insult.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 23-11-2009(5): <strong>Negate</strong> is to express a <em>negative</em> with the <em>mouth</em>. Interestingly, in many languages, in order to<strong> negate</strong>, the <em>mouth</em> moves in the same way: English <strong>n</strong>o, French <strong>n</strong>on, Japanese <strong>n</strong>ai. HINT: ne<em>gate</em> contains gate = 口 . (hint courtesy of Katsuo).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivoSF">ivoSF</a>] 7-9-2006(5): The evil magician uses negative energy, the good magician uses positive energy, when they cast spells at eachother the spells are<strong> negate</strong>d.(casting spells require mouths).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 14-10-2010(4): To<strong> negate</strong> an idea, you have to say something. Something <em>negative</em> comes out of your <em>mouth</em>. 否定する ひていする<strong> negate</strong>, deny; 否 (いいえ) : no, nay; 否 (いや) : no, nay, don&#039;t want!
