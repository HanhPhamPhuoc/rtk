## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 4-7-2007(257): Little is it known that a<strong> rainbow</strong> is actually created by <em>insects</em> of different colours flying in formation, a <em>craft</em> they have perfected to create the<strong> rainbow</strong>s we see today. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 7-7-2008(103): <strong>Rainbow</strong> is of course created by billions of colored <em>insects</em> (what? you really thought it was an optical illusion?). However I had problems remembering that the <em>insect</em> primitive goes on the left. If you have similar difficulties, try this:<strong> rainbow</strong> is an <em>Insect-Craft</em>. Mnemonic: <strong>I.C.<strong> Rainbow</strong></strong> (I see<strong> rainbow</strong>). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 1-4-2008(36): For my arts and CRAFTs project at school, I made a<strong> rainbow</strong> out of dead BUGs spray painted different colors and glued to some paper. The teacher was not amused. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Autolycus91982">Autolycus91982</a>] 21-7-2009(16): I see<strong> rainbow</strong>. I.C.<strong> rainbow</strong>. Insect Craft<strong> Rainbow</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcaruso">mcaruso</a>] 2-6-2013(14): You know Skittles, &quot;Taste the<strong> RAINBOW</strong>&quot;? The colorant that gives red Skittles their deep crimson color comes from crushing a type of <em>insect</em> called cochineal. So the next time you taste the<strong> RAINBOW</strong>, remember that you&#039;re really tasting <em>insects</em> <em>crafted</em> into sweets. (See: <a href="http://snopes.com/food/ingredient/bugjuice.asp">http://snopes.com/food/ingredient/bugjuice.asp</a>). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 27-6-2006(8): The fairy queen uses magical <em>insects</em> to spin her a<strong> rainbow</strong>. Those <em>bugs</em> sure know their <em>craft</em>! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/allanh">allanh</a>] 8-3-2009(6): The iridescent scales of <em>insects</em> are carefully <em>crafted</em> to shine with all the colours of the<strong> rainbow</strong> as you view them from different angles. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise">gsantise</a>] 30-9-2007(6): Think of Nausicaa looking up at the sky at what she thinks is a<strong> rainbow</strong>. Oh no! Actually they are <em>Insect Craft!!!</em> The Ohm must be angry again!! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 26-11-2007(5): A<strong> rainbow</strong> crafted from millions of iridescent scarab shells. (Position: Think: bug-crafted.).
