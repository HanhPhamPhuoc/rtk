heisig: "Of all the things we can do with our <i>mouths</i>, speech is the one that requires the greatest distinctness and clarity. Hence the kanji for <b>say</b> has four little sound-waves, indicating the complexity of the achievement."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jinka">jinka</a>] 28-4-2006(109): A pictogram of someone <strong>saying</strong> a <em>four</em> letter word from their <em>mouth</em> after the censors have gotten a hold of it. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg">sethg</a>] 4-2-2009(68): This is simple a pictogram of a <em>mouth</em><strong> SAY</strong>ing something. The lines are soundwaves. No need to complicate it. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 4-11-2005(22): This is such a hard one for me to remember in stories so I use Socrates to personify<strong> say</strong> since he is an orator. Just make Socrates the subject of your stories and whenever Socrates shows up you&#039;ll know this character should be written. Just picture him in his toga with a hand up in the air looking philisophical. You can try some other well spoken individual as long as they bring to mind speech, words, or<strong> say</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matstc">matstc</a>] 9-6-2008(18): Before you<strong> say</strong> something in chinese, make sure you master the <em>4 tones</em> that can come out of your <em>mouth</em> so that you don&#039;t embarrass yourself. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 20-1-2008(7): Facciamo <strong>quattro chiacchere..</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Oyabecory">Oyabecory</a>] 23-3-2013(5): <strong>Say</strong>: a, i, u, e &quot;o&quot; (Standard way to<strong> say</strong> the Japanese phonetic alphabet,<strong> say</strong> 4 vowels then end with &quot;O&quot;.). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 20-11-2008(5): When we<strong> say</strong> anything we actually exercise &quot;four&quot; muscles in our &quot;mouth&quot;. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stryder">Stryder</a>] 13-2-2008(4): For a concrete, relevant primitive, try <em>Powerpoint presentation</em>. The box is the projector and the lines are the projected image. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-1-2006(4): Tip : for the primitive meaning I have used the meaning of &quot;word&quot;, whenever I needed a solid (not abstract) image, I pictured <em>words</em> that have been cut out of a newspaper, for example (as when someone composes black mail). These little pieces of paper with words written on them, can come out of someone&#039;s mouth, be sprinkled on the floor, poured into a funnel, etc. Each time with a clear visual imagery. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Termy">Termy</a>] 25-5-2013(2): Remembering this Kanji in itself is easy, considering how many times it&#039;s used, but it&#039;s important to have a clear visual image of something related to words so it doesn&#039;t get lost in whatever stories you create for other Kanji characters. Picture a specific person (a famous actor perhaps) with a distinct voice (James Earl Jones, Sean Connery, etc) and always use that person for the primitive.
