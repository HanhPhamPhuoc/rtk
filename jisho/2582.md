## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 30-1-2007(26): The<strong> ancestral shrine</strong> has an <em>altar</em> that shows <em>little</em> <em>reclining</em> figurines of ancestors.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 24-5-2010(14): Just a note: This is a rarely used kanji, the unsimplified version, 禰 , is far more common, and seeing as we&#039;re trying to be kanji masters, we&#039;d all might as well use the traditional (correct) version.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 7-8-2009(5): In countries where ancestors are worshiped, <em>small</em> children are taught to <em>lie down</em> (prostrate themselves) at the <em>altar</em> that is their<strong> ancestral shrine</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 6-7-2007(3): In fact, <em>little Clark Kent</em> was sent into space <em>reclining</em> on the<strong> ancestral shrine</strong> of Krypton. Later he placed the <em>alter</em> within his fortress of solitude.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 22-12-2010(2): 禰<a href="../31152">Unicode-0x79b0</a> (#31152 禰) is the real version including let it be. STORY: Unless you want to piss off your ancestors, <em>let the altar in your<strong> ancestral shrine</strong> be</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 28-10-2010(2): At the <em>altar</em> of the<strong> ancestral shrine</strong>, if you <em>recline</em> even just a <em>little</em>, you&#039;ll be whacked with a stick for disrespect.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sskaggs">sskaggs</a>] 4-11-2011(1): The<strong> ancestral shrine</strong> has an <em>evil altar</em> that shows the <em>reclining little</em> figurines of ancestors. -- origin of h/k kana ね and ネ. 祢宜 （ねぎ）senior priest of shinto shrine. (RTK2 says &quot;low-ranking,&quot; but 2 Jap dictionaries say &quot;senior&quot;). the classical version is <a href="../31152">Unicode-0x79b0</a> (#31152 禰), and is often used for this word in place of this kanji.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 4-2-2011(): What a shame, the <em>altar</em> of the<strong> ancestral shrine</strong> was <em>lying down</em> and so <em>small</em> at that.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gruuf">gruuf</a>] 1-11-2010(): In fact, <em>little Clark Kent</em> was sent into space reclining on the <strong>ancestral shrine</strong> of Krypton. Later he placed the <em>altar</em> within his fortress of solitude. (thanks ikmys) Also see <a href="../31152">Unicode-0x79b0</a> (#31152 禰) (禰) for the more common old version, you should be really learning (thanks thecite).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 21-2-2010(): <strong>Ancestral shrine</strong>s in Japan are miniature versions of larger shrines that one sometimes sees in the countryside on a family&#039;s plot of land. To pray there, one must approach the <em>altar</em> and <em>prostrate oneself</em>, because the<strong> ancestral shrine</strong> is very <em>small</em>. (At a normal shrine, a simple bow is sufficient.) <a href="http://bit.ly/ancestralshrine">http://bit.ly/ancestralshrine</a>.
