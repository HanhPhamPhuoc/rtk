heisig: "Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the <b>marsh</b>lands are low and near a source of <i>water</i> that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes <b>marshy</b> is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to <i>seduce</i> the <i>water</i> over to its side. But, like most inordinate <i>seductions</i>, the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy <b>marsh</b>."
