heisig: Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own.... On the left is the <i>water</i>&nbsp;- that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for <i>morning</i> learned back in Frame 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word <b>tide</b>, just think of it in connection with the character for <i>eventide</i> that we learned back in Frame 115. Here we have the <i>morning</i>-<b>tide</b>, its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own.
