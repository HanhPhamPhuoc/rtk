This key word is a counter for books. It differs from <i>scrapbook</i> both in the writing order and in the extension of the second horizontal stroke.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 22-11-2006(134): Pictograph. I think of that Harry Potter spell book that had to be bound shut coz it wanted to eat you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 4-3-2008(63): 冊 さつ 1: counter for books A heavy scrapbook so full that flowers are sticking out. Only if a scrapbook is that full, it can be called a heavy book.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rabite">rabite</a>] 19-7-2008(58): Pictograph of three books tied up for transport.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 10-1-2010(34): A pictograph of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy viewed end on: All <em>3</em><strong> tome</strong>s held together with <em>one ribbon</em> - &quot;one ribbon to bind them all&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 8-10-2006(14): Hint:<strong> Tome</strong> rhymes with &quot;comb&quot;, and it looks a little bit similar to the comb primitive.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 12-4-2008(4): My copy of the<strong> Tome</strong> of Magic is so worn, the pages are spilling out the sides like the petals of a <em>flower</em>. But it was signed by Gary Gygax (RIP), so I&#039;ve put the whole thing under a <em>glass canopy</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inuki">inuki</a>] 30-10-2006(4): <strong>Tome</strong> shows a scrapbook with a big binding around it. This is the bible, the counter to Darwin’s scrapbook.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 29-5-2013(2): This<strong> tome</strong>, (RTK Vol. 1) that I currently <em>&#039;comb&#039;</em>, is just the first <em>one</em>... (This is written the same as the last four strokes of the <em>comb</em> primitive, followed by <em>one</em>).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 19-1-2010(2): Here we have the <strong>Necronomicon</strong>, a book that needs to be <em>strapped</em> shut (to keep careless, curious readers from going insane).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 10-10-2009(2): <strong>Tome</strong> = not a <em>comb</em>. I know it&#039;s not a <em>comb</em> because it doesn&#039;t have a handle on top, and it has an extra bar across the bristles, making them useless.
