## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 9-4-2009(34): <em>Two</em> birds high up in a <em>tree</em> <em>drying</em> out after flying through a storm. &quot;How will we get back on track? We lost our bearings!&quot; number one cries. &quot;Don&#039;t worry,&quot; the other one says, as he flips out his mobile. &quot;I have it <strong>bookmarked</strong>.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 5-8-2009(19): I love to use dried leaves as<strong> bookmark</strong>s. Every time I go by a tree, I pluck off a couple of leaves and then dry them to later use as<strong> bookmark</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 14-4-2007(6): He was reading his book up a <em>tree</em>, and used <em>clotheslines</em> for a<strong> bookmark</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 14-11-2009(2): I read till both my eyes were dry and I had massive wood poking up from below so I<strong> bookmark</strong>ed my place and took care of business.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 1-11-2010(1): 旅の栞 , 栞紐 , <a href="../2523">bookmark</a> (#2523 栞) しおり ... Parts: 干 , 干 , 木 ... Note: More common extended meaning is <strong>Guidebook</strong> ... Story: In my bird watching <strong>guide book</strong>, I<strong> BookMark</strong> the pages with <em>Dried</em> bits of <em>Tree</em> sometimes leaves, but also sometimes strips of bark.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 29-10-2010(1): This book was so <em>dry</em>, I wore out <em>two</em> <strong>bookmarks</strong> trying to get through it. I would&#039;ve been better if it had stayed a <em>tree</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 7-12-2011(): <em>Two dry</em> leaves at the top of a <em>tree</em> make good <strong>bookmark</strong>s, since they are about to fall off anyways (it&#039;s autumn I guess).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gruuf">gruuf</a>] 23-10-2010(): I <strong>bookmarked</strong> a link to the lyrics of AKB48&#039;s song 桜の栞 (sakura no shiori). The mood reminds me of the <em>dry</em> leaves falling from the <em>tree</em>. (To depict more than one leaf falling, two <em>dry</em> ones are shown on the tree top.) ( Link to lyrics: <a href="http://kashinavi.com/song_view.html?41026">http://kashinavi.com/song_view.html?41026</a> ).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(): I read until my eyes get <em>dry</em>, so I use my <em>wooden</em><strong> bookmark</strong> and go to bed.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 14-1-2009(): We collected some <em>wood</em> but it was <em>too dry</em> to be used as fire<em>wood</em> so we used it as<strong> bookmark</strong>s instead.
