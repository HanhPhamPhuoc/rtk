## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 29-4-2007(215): A pictograph of Wolverine&#039;s adamantium<strong> claw</strong>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(54): Pictograph, see book. * I prefer the primitive meaning of an eagle rather than vulture. Somehow vulture makes me think more about meat and dead corpses than<strong> claw</strong>s. An eagle however immediately brings to my mind the image of an eagle plunging into a stream catching fish in his<strong> claw</strong>s, or that of the great eagles rescuing Bilbo and his party in Jrr Tolkien&#039;s novel “Bilbo the Hobbit”.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 16-8-2007(18): Pictograph of a vulture&#039;s<strong> CLAW</strong>. The<strong> CLAW</strong> DROPS and leaves a STREAM of blood. *Primitive = vulture.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 25-1-2008(13): Use the &quot;w&quot; in<strong> claw</strong> to remember the shape of this kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 26-2-2010(5): A<strong> claw</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 12-4-2008(5): Looks like a<strong> claw</strong>, doesn&#039;t it?

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/potempkin">potempkin</a>] 26-9-2008(3): <strong>Dr.<strong> Claw</strong></strong>. &quot;I&#039;ll get you next time, Gadget!... Next time!&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kirkaking">kirkaking</a>] 18-7-2012(2): <em>Drop</em>ping his<strong> claw</strong> in what looks like a &quot;<em>stream</em>&quot;, the vulture scooped up his next meal.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brainrobert1">brainrobert1</a>] 14-11-2010(2): This is the primitive VULTURE. Also<strong> claw</strong> and fingernails. tsume <a href="midori://search?text=爪。">爪。</a> Vultures have<strong> claw</strong>s and we have fingernails - two different words in English only one in Japanese who therefore all have<strong> CLAW</strong>S.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma">shimouma</a>] 12-4-2008(2): Just like a<strong> claw</strong>. Wonder if Atari will ever<strong> claw</strong> their way back?
