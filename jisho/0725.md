## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 7-5-2006(121): Pretty obvious: to<strong> return</strong> is to turn back on the road you&#039;re on and go the opposite way.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 16-7-2008(98): <strong>Return</strong> here means &quot;return something&quot; rather than &quot;go back&quot;. So here it goes, for those of you who are also suffering of the Japanese summer ;-) I ordered an <em>anti</em> mosquito kit, but it was damaged on the <em>way</em> so I had to<strong> return</strong> it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 6-11-2007(67): In &quot;The<strong> Return</strong> of the <em>anti-hero</em>&quot;, Clint Eastwood kicks the villain in the crotch, pushes them off the cliff and onto a busy <em>highway</em>. A tiring movie franchise to say the least....

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 15-6-2009(44): If you&#039;re ANTI-ROAD then of course, you&#039;ll just<strong> return</strong> home.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cullingsong">cullingsong</a>] 16-11-2008(36): I am not sure why, but I bought a road. Why did I do that? I hate roads. I&#039;m anti road! I&#039;d rather fly. I&#039;d better see if I can<strong> return</strong> it.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skellyfish">skellyfish</a>] 16-2-2009(29): &quot;<strong>Return</strong> our land!<strong> Return</strong> our land!&quot; - the cries of ANTI-ROAD protestors whose houses have been claimed under eminent domain laws to build a new ROAD.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 12-5-2012(24): The English word<strong> return</strong> translates into many kanji: <a href="../1081">re-</a> (#1081 戻) [odoru] means to turn back and<strong> return</strong> to where you just were; <a href="../1230">homecoming</a> (#1230 帰) [kaeru] means to<strong> return</strong> home; <a href="../837">send back</a> (#837 還) [kaeru (rarely) or kan (on reading)] means<strong> return</strong> in the sense of recycling or that Russia should<strong> return</strong> the Kuril Islands to Japan; <a href="../725">return</a> (#725 返) [kaesu] means to<strong> return</strong> something. Story: The crook took everything when our <em>anti</em>-hero disintigrated the <em>road</em> with an <em>anti</em>-matter weapon so the crook couldn&#039;t leave and had to<strong> return</strong> what he took.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BlackMarsh">BlackMarsh</a>] 2-2-2006(11): You have to<strong> return</strong> all the good things you were ever given to you when you choose the road of the anti-Christ.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(8): &quot;<strong>Return</strong> our land! <strong>Return</strong> our land!&quot; cries the protestors of the <em>Anti-</em><em>Road</em> group.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(7): This is the road of “no-no”<strong> return</strong>. Catchy mnemonic, but be sure to picture the road and the “no-no” sign somewhere.
