3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikemorr">mikemorr</a>] 12-4-2009(28): <em>Rice</em> above <em>woman</em> is the character 娄, which can refer to a constellation. (Mnemonic: The stars of the <strong>constellation</strong> are like grains of <em>rice</em>, forming the shape of a <em>woman</em> in the sky.) 娄 also appears in <a href="../929">number</a> (#929 数) and <a href="../2221">frequently</a> (#2221 屡). <strong>Watchtower</strong>: A wooden <strong>watchtower</strong> lets you get a better view of the <em>constellation</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 21-12-2007(7): When I see this kanji i think of the Bob Dylan song made famous by Jimi Hendrix &quot;All along the<strong> watchtower</strong> (tall tree outpost), the princes kept the view (to see nobody was stealing the rice), while the women came and went, their foot-servants too.&quot;.
