## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 5-12-2007(209): After work, the <em>French maid</em> goes <em>home</em> and lies down with a <em>turtle</em>. Turtle? Well, he&#039;s sloooow and always hard... (thanks to Nukemarine and Wakela!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-9-2007(59): After being hit on the head <a href="../1148">encroach</a> (#1148 侵), the <em>condom salesman</em> goes back to his <em>house</em> to<strong> lie down</strong>. He hasn&#039;t made a single sale today, so he doesn&#039;t have enough money to buy a pillow. He lies down on his pet <em>turtle</em> and cries himself to sleep.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Koos83">Koos83</a>] 21-12-2009(51): The <em>French maid</em> I hired cleans my <em>house</em> as slowly as a <em>turtle</em>, but I keep her on, because I love to &#039;lie down&#039; with her...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 7-7-2009(30): While the <em>maid</em> in our <em>house</em> was <strong>lying down</strong>, I touched her <em>crotch</em>, but there was half a <em>turtle shell</em> covering it. Nice foresight girl!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-10-2007(18): For this kanji,<strong> LIE DOWN</strong> in your HOUSE and imagine a MAID (broom, crown and crotch should make an easy picture). In her HOUSE, she gets lax and<strong> LIE DOWN</strong>, with her feet propped on a TURTLE table. Maid works great in the previous two kanji&#039;s, did it not?
