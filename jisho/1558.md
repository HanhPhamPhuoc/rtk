## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 5-4-2006(186): <strong>Sex</strong> is the only <em>state of mind</em> for many men through their whole <em>life</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 11-1-2008(113): When you&#039;re in the <em>state of mind</em> for creating new <em>lives</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 7-2-2008(64): I think this can also mean <strong>gender</strong>--one could look at the differences between <strong>gender</strong> and <strong>sex</strong>: one is a <em>state of mind</em>, the other is set biologically in the <em>cells</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 19-11-2007(57): <em>Data&#039;s</em> <em>life</em> did not begin with<strong> sex</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 3-9-2007(21): Despite being of the same <strong>sex</strong>, <em>Data</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em> do each other knowing it&#039;s the only<strong> sex</strong> they&#039;ll ever get. (Image: do I even have to paint this one...?).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 14-9-2008(13): (This refers to &#039;gender&#039;, not<strong> sex</strong>ual intercourse.) When <em>Data</em>&#039;s creator decided to give him <em>life</em>, he had a hard time deciding what<strong> sex</strong> he wanted Data to be. He finally decided to make him male, and thus we have our beloved <em>Data</em> today.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-10-2008(12): The <em>state of mind</em> you have in <em>life</em> is determined by your<strong> sex</strong>. If you&#039;re female, you&#039;re playing hard-to-get. If you&#039;re male, you&#039;re chasin&#039; it.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shuusaku">shuusaku</a>] 9-1-2013(10): <em>this ideogram is used for<strong> sex</strong> in the sense of gender, such as 女性 or 男性 . Therefore the story goes as: </em> you need to be in the right STATE OF MIND to have<strong> SEX</strong> with a person of the opposite <strong>GENDER</strong> and create a new LIFE together.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/endote">endote</a>] 24-11-2010(7): Is our gender a state of mind, or a way of life?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BStoobs">BStoobs</a>] 25-11-2007(6): Believe it or not, the whole &quot;say (セイ) and show (ショウ) saga (さが)&quot; of human<strong> sex</strong> is a facade - all that state of mind is really about is cells - sperm, egg, meeting, dividing, etc.
