heisig: "First note the stroke order of this character, which did not really evolve from the <i>heart</i>, even though we take it that way. If one takes it as a pictograph &quot;dividing&quot; <i>the heart</i> in half, then one has one of those <b>invariably</b> true bits of human anatomy: the fact that each <i>heart</i> is divided into two halves."

## Heisig story:

First note the stroke order of this character, which did not really evolve from the <i>heart</i>, even though we take it that way. If one takes it as a pictograph &quot;dividing&quot; <i>the heart</i> in half, then one has one of those <b>invariably</b> true bits of human anatomy: the fact that each <i>heart</i> is divided into two halves.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 27-10-2007(203): You swear you&#039;ll be in love forever, but<strong> invariably</strong> there comes a time when your <em>heart</em> is <em>divided</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 12-6-2008(97): For this kanji I<strong> invariably</strong> got the stroke order wrong. I nearly lost <em>heart</em>, but decided to <em>stick</em> (pun) to it. Then I noticed the order is 1) katakana ソ (altered slightly); 2) fishhook; 3) two drops. Now I<strong> invariably</strong> get it right.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 21-9-2009(71): A <em>stake</em> through the <em>heart</em><strong> invariably</strong> kills a vampire. (As a primitive this can take the meaning &#039;<strong>vampire</strong>&#039;).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a>] 16-8-2006(20): A heart that has been slashed becomes<strong> invariably</strong> altered forever.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matstc">matstc</a>] 14-1-2009(19): When you say &#039;cross my heart&#039;, you will<strong> invariably</strong> keep your word.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 14-5-2009(9): <strong>INVARIABLY</strong> your HEART will be SLASHED at least once.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 11-12-2009(8): A <em>heart</em> <em>divided</em> will<strong> invariably</strong> recover. (Thought I&#039;d take a positive slant).　ヒツ 必要 ひつよう(necessity)、 必ず かならず.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimitha">jimitha</a>] 7-8-2008(6): This character looks like a divided or crossed heart -- so I&#039;m going to make the primitive meaning a &quot;cross-your-heart bra&quot;. This will pay off in the next frame.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 22-12-2007(6): It&#039;s a well known fact that in order to kill a vampire, you must<strong> invariably</strong> pierce his <em>heart</em> with a <em>stake</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 23-2-2011(5): When I sew (katakana &#039;so&#039;), I<strong> invariably</strong> <em>hook</em> the needle into my skin, causing <em>drops</em> of blood to fall out. 必要 (ひつよう) : necessary; 必ずしも (かならずしも) : (not) always, (not) necessarily, (not) all, (not) entirely; 必ず (かならず) : certainly.
