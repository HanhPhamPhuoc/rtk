## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 2-12-2008(58): There is a certain restaurant in West-Shinjuku that serves its<strong> noodles</strong> made of BARLEY in a MASK instead of a plate. I love these theme-restaurants! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 3-2-2010(38): I always eat <em>barley</em><strong> noodles</strong> with a <em>mask</em> on - it stops them splashing in your face. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 9-6-2008(18): Don&#039;t be fooled! That&#039;s just <em>barley masq</em>uerading as<strong> noodles</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 22-10-2010(5):   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/素麺">素麺</a>  ,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/老麺">老麺</a>  ,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/麺">麺</a>   (麵)<a href="../2752">noodles</a> <span class="index">(#2752 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/麺">麺</a>)</span> メン ... Parts:  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/麦">麦</a>  ,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/面">面</a>   ... The most common use for this, Ramen, is actually written in Kana exclusively. The Kanji is used to talk about the<strong> noodles</strong> themselves before they are cooked into a dish. ... Story: How did <em>Chris Barley</em> get so fat? He lived near an all-you-can-eat <strong>Noodle</strong> shop (Ramen, Somen, etc.). Even after they banned him, he would just put on a mask and keep coming back. Richard Nixon mask? Check. Tony Blair Mask? No good, that mouth is too small. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(5): A <em>mask</em> made entirely of <em>barley</em><strong> noodles</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/comeauch">comeauch</a>] 11-8-2012(2): (+sgrant) I always eat barley<strong> noodles</strong> with a mask on - it stops them splashing in your face. Try it without mask and you&#039;ll see, barley<strong> noodles</strong> are much more heavy than regular ones! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 10-6-2010(1): ALICE stole the<strong> NOODLES</strong> and RAN AWAY in a MASK.
