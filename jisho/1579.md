It is so cute all the time, though it cannot say a word! In the end when it gets dispelled and returns to its former royal being it lets off a loud <em>sigh</em>! What a relief to be a human again!! I wanted to let off that <em>sigh</em> a long time ago and finally I can again, having my <em>mouth</em> back!
