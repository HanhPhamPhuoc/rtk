heisig: "Picture yourself grabbing hold of the two strokes poking out the top of the kanji and wrenching them apart, thus giving the sense of <b>bend</b>. If you think of them as deriving from the element for <i>brains</i> beneath (of course, the middle stroke has been reduplicated and pulled out to where it can be grabbed hold of), you can associate the key word with <b>bending</b> someone's mind to your own point of view."
