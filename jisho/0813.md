## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 11-2-2007(258): This kanji shows up in a lot of words related to the legal process. Try this image: using a very outdated judicial<strong> method</strong>, the people of Salem dunked accused witches in the <em>water</em> until they were all <em>gone</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 19-5-2007(102): There already was a <a href="../418">system</a> (#418 制) for butchering cows, a <a href="../421">technique</a> (#421 芸) for turning smoke into flowers - why can&#039;t there be a <em>method</em> of about the same relevance for making <em>water</em> <em>gone</em>? Evaporation anyone?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 26-10-2006(63): Following from the last frame; when rubbing isn&#039;t good enough, WATER is the best<strong> METHOD</strong> for making sure the SOIL on your ELBOW is GONE.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 21-3-2008(43): If all the water is gone, we must develop new<strong> method</strong>s to survive. (Imagine Earth devoid of water, the opposite of the movie Waterworld).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TaylorSan">TaylorSan</a>] 31-1-2009(22): The Heisig<strong> Method</strong> will Water down your kanji problems, until at some point, they are gone.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 6-11-2008(14): The<strong> method</strong> used by Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz was to throw <em>water</em> on the Wicked Witch of the West to make her <em>gone</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 13-7-2008(10): This kanji is associated with &quot;methods&quot;, &quot;laws&quot;, and &quot;religious tenets&quot;. To help recall the keyword of<strong> METHOD</strong>, I&#039;m going to use a story that also employs the &#039;religious tenets&#039; side: baptism. Depending on your affiliation, you could be baptized by the Pope ( 法王 ; ほうおう) or a Buddhist high priest ( 法主 ; ほうしゅ) in a ceremony that uses <em>water</em> to dedicate you to a new purpose (your old life/ways are <em>gone</em>).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 7-12-2006(10): <strong>Method</strong>ists could also use water for a baptism to make your sins all gone. (or maybe that&#039;s just Catholic, but for story purposes...). (scottamus,21-2-2006) Actually, it is<strong> Method</strong>ism. See <a href="http://www.saintaquinas.com/Methodists.html">http://www.saintaquinas.com/Methodists.html</a>,.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 13-6-2011(7): Since I&#039;ve adopted a Taoist image for<strong> method</strong>, I haven&#039;t failed to recall or confuse it with <a href="../421">technique</a> (#421 芸) or with <a href="../712">skill</a> (#712 技). The unyielding force of <em>water</em> flowing over rocks until the rocks are <em>GONE,</em> leaves an indelible image of the<strong> method</strong> of water.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 24-1-2010(7): [+Robotact]. Alliterative mnemonic for keeping 制 <a href="../418">system</a> (#418 制), 芸 <a href="../421">technique</a> (#421 芸), &amp;<strong> method</strong> straight: <em>System of Slaughtering</em> (cows), <em>Technique of Turning</em> (clouds to flowers), <em>Method of Making</em> (water gone).
