## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saizen">saizen</a>] 3-4-2009(40): Two good friends looking at their childhood <em>tree</em> house and remembering how it seemed like <em>generations</em> ago since they were up in it<strong> chatter</strong>ing away all night.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-2-2007(28): <em>Mouths</em> like to<strong> chatter</strong> about the new <em>generation</em> on the <em>tree</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 7-1-2009(14): The only thing that comes out of the MOUTHS of this GENERATION of young people, is<strong> chatter</strong> and<strong> chatter</strong>. I can&#039;t even escape the<strong> chatter</strong> on top of a TREE.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/danie115">danie115</a>] 27-12-2008(9): Tarzan<strong> chatter</strong>s with his mouth like the monkeys.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 10-2-2007(8): The <em>butterflies</em>, who do not look like insects anymore when they&#039;ve just emerged (minus insects), open their new <em>mouths</em> and start to<strong> chatter</strong> immediately.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 14-11-2010(4): 喋る <a href="../2158">chatter</a> (#2158 喋) ？, しゃべる ... Parts: 口 , Tarzan枼 (cf: 葉 <a href="../228">leaf</a> (#228 葉), 蝶 <a href="../521">butterfly</a> (#521 蝶), 防諜 <a href="../2726">secret agent</a> (#2726 諜), 符牒 <a href="../2926">label</a> (#2926 牒)). ... Katsuo&#039;s Tip: Let Tarzan = generation + tree -- because Tarzan lives with several generations of his family at the top of a tree. ... Similars: 喋る <a href="../2158">chatter</a> (#2158 喋), 唖 <a href="../2958">babble</a> (#2958 唖) ... Story: Story: <em>Tarzan</em><strong> chatter</strong>s with his <em>mouth</em> like the monkeys.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 28-6-2008(4): This is a<strong> chatter</strong> <em>tree</em> like the kind found in Zelda 3 - when you&#039;re walking around in the Dark World, all of the trees have <em>mouths</em> on them - but the<strong> Chatter</strong> <em>Trees</em> are the only ones that can talk. You can bump into them and they will tell you about their old <em>generation</em> (before they were turned into <em>trees</em>). It&#039;s pretty annoying to have to bump into all of them though - but if here&#039;s a secret - if you turn up the volume all the way, you can hear a low <strong>chatter</strong>ing noise when you walk by one.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 14-6-2010(3): <strong>Chatter</strong>ing <em>mouths</em> do nothing to save <em>generations</em> of <em>trees</em> being cut down worldwide.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kusterdu">kusterdu</a>] 4-11-2009(3): If trees had mouths, they&#039;d<strong> chatter</strong> for generations (they&#039;ve got nothing else to do!).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 26-9-2008(3): (let <em>generation</em> &amp; <em>tree</em> = &#039;<em><strong>leaf</strong></em>&#039; <em>primitive</em>, add the flower radical to make it a true &quot;leaf&quot; kanji) // <strong>Chattering</strong> <em><strong>mouths</strong></em> sometimes sound like the <strong>chattering</strong>/rattling/rustling of fallen <em><strong>leaves</strong></em> in Autumn/Fall. // other <em><strong>leaf</strong></em> <em>primitives</em> : <a href="../521">butterfly</a> (#521 蝶), <a href="../2726">secret agent</a> (#2726 諜), <a href="../2926">label</a> (#2926 牒).
