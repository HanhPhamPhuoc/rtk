## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 13-6-2006(158): <strong>Mercy</strong> comes from the doubly mysterious heart of God. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mullr">mullr</a>] 20-1-2009(93): Two gremlins are atop a victim, tearing out his heart while he begs for<strong> mercy</strong>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Fluhk">Fluhk</a>] 9-6-2006(57): Here we see the DOUBLE-MYSTERIOUS Siamese twins again, at the<strong> MERCY</strong> of the machines that pump blood through their veins, since the single HEART they share won&#039;t do the job... 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 24-5-2006(24): Gandalf (<a href="../1383">mysterious</a> <span class="index">(#1383 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/玄">玄</a>)</span>) shows no<strong> mercy</strong> and rips his evil double&#039;s heart out. Instead of destroying evil, his malevolent act has merged the two of them into the grey Gandalf. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atylmo">atylmo</a>] 30-3-2009(23): <strong>Mercy</strong> is a <em>doubly mysterious</em> turn of the <em>heart</em>. On the one hand, everybody wants it, but on the other hardly anybody gives it. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-2-2008(12): Top part has the meaning of rapid growth/increase of small objects: 「茲 しげる culture (biol); here」. Tribbles (Star Trek) fit perfectly that role. Would you have the <em>heart</em> to kill a <em>tribble</em>? They are cute and harmless, please have<strong> mercy</strong>!! (unless you are a Klingon). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/walexander5">walexander5</a>] 13-9-2008(10): <em>Gandalf and Sarumon</em> originally became friends when Sarumon gave <strong><a href="../1388">nourishing</a> <span class="index">(#1388 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/滋">滋</a>)</span></strong> <em>water</em> to Gandalf as an orphaned child. Showing <strong><a href="../1389">mercy</a> <span class="index">(#1389 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/慈">慈</a>)</span></strong> to the child who had won his <em>heart</em>, he decided to teach him the ways of the wizard. Many years later, however, his heart would turn to <em>stone</em> as he was attracted like a <strong><a href="../1390">magnet</a> <span class="index">(#1390 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/磁">磁</a>)</span></strong> to the powerful and evil Sauron. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samusam">samusam</a>] 29-1-2008(10): The human <em>heart</em> is <em>doubly mysterious</em> for the way it puts<strong> mercy</strong> above itself. (thanks to various others). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 29-8-2009(6): Her heart is as big as a pineapple and full of<strong> mercy</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 21-1-2008(6): A bull (ANIMAL HORNS) finds two perfectly placed COCOONS that he could impale and kill with his HORNS in one blow. But his HEART gets the best of him, and he shows them<strong> MERCY</strong>. ---Another story with a Pokemon theme: TAURUS corners two METAPOD&#039;S and is about to kill them both in one blow. Then that wussy Ash teaches him some crap about<strong> MERCY</strong> and compassion, and TAURUS has a change of HEART.
