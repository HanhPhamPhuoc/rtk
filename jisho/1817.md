## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 27-6-2010(44): The witches <em>piggy bank</em> was cursed with a spell causing any thief who stole it&#039;s contents to fall ill. The <em>illness</em> would result in the victim being covered from head to toe in a mass of <strong>carbuncles</strong>. Crime doesn&#039;t pay!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asayoru">Asayoru</a>] 10-11-2010(19): <em>Caveman</em> has to open up his <em>piggy bank</em> to receive treatment for his monstrous <strong>carbuncle</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 25-1-2011(5): His <em>sickness</em> caused numerous<strong> carbuncle</strong>s, which when emptied by the doctors also emptied his <em>piggy bank</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 9-8-2011(4): In this kanji the <em>Caveman</em> has a <em>piggy bank</em>-shaped<strong> carbuncle</strong> under his skin. Hmm, well, at least it looks kind of unique.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 2-6-2010(4): There goes the lonely miser, all covered in <strong>CARBUNCLE</strong>s. The local lore says that his hideous <em>ILLNESS</em> is divine retribution for his avarice: the <strong>CARBUNCLE</strong>s are said to be shaped like <em>PIGGY BANK</em>s!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nussram">nussram</a>] 3-8-2012(3): The sick caveman is removing his<strong> carbuncle</strong>s (boils) and putting them in his piggy bank. “Who knows, maybe I can sell them on eBay someday.”.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-11-2011(3): 胃潰瘍 , 膿瘍 , 腫瘍 , <a href="../v4/3026">carbuncle</a> (#3026 瘍) ヨウ(昜) ... Parts:疒, 昜 (cf: 容易 <a href="../v4/1051">easy</a> (#1051 易), 腸 <a href="../v4/544">intestines</a> (#544 腸), 場所 <a href="../v4/545">location</a> (#545 場), お湯 <a href="../v4/546">hot water</a> (#546 湯), 傷 <a href="../v4/996">wound</a> (#996 傷), 太陽 <a href="../v4/1300">sunshine</a> (#1300 陽), 楊 <a href="../v4/2473">purple willow</a> (#2473 楊)) ... Story: If you think about how you make a <em>Piggy Bank</em>, by ripping the tail off of a <em>sow</em>, sewing it up and then leaving it in the <em>sun</em> to dry, it&#039;s not a surprise that the 病気 that comes from that is a nasty <strong>Carbuncle</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 19-12-2012(2): I wonder how much English vocabulary I have actually learned while doing RTK. Anyway I think this should really be called boil, but a homonym of that was already used for <a href="../v4/1257">boil</a> (#1257 煮). My <em>piggy bank</em> has got a <em>sickness</em>: I lost the stopper and now the hole looks like a grotesque<strong> carbuncle</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/manubear">manubear</a>] 10-8-2012(2): My <em>piggy bank</em> has an <em>illness</em>. It&#039;s covered in <strong>boil</strong>s and when you put money in it <em>throws up</em>! ( 腫瘍 , 胃潰瘍 ).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/effer">effer</a>] 11-5-2012(1): If your<strong> carbuncle</strong> are the size of piggybank coins, you&#039;re definitely sick.
