## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 13-10-2006(199): You first wash you clothes with <em>water</em> and wring them until they are just<strong> damp</strong> before hanging them in a <em>row</em> under the <em>sun</em> to dry. If you don&#039;t wring them<strong> damp</strong> first they will take days to dry!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 20-6-2007(53): When your things are<strong> damp</strong>, you line them up in a row under the sun.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-12-2006(28): An image: a shirt hangs on the oars of an old <em>rowboat</em>. Though it is slowly being dried by the <em>sun</em> high above, the occasional <em>drops of water</em> from it indicate that it is still<strong> damp</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(11): I&#039;ll bet most of us have had this experience at a water park... You are gazing at the <em>water</em> hungrily while standing under the hot <em>sun</em>, waiting in a long <em>row</em> to get on the water slide. By the time it&#039;s your turn, you&#039;ve been under the sun so long that you&#039;re not even all that wet anymore - just a little bit<strong> damp</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 14-7-2007(9): The <em>row</em> of penguins find themselves in the front row, right under the <em>sun</em>. It&#039;s very hot, so they spray themselves with cool <em>water</em>. This of course makes the entire theatre very<strong> damp</strong>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 11-2-2010(7): My basement is always<strong> damp</strong>. One time I went down, and it was flooded with <em>water</em>. I paddled a <em>rowboat</em> over to the window so I could open it and let the <em>sun</em> in to dry up the water. (Position: Your rowboat is below the sun).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 27-7-2009(5): The Vikings&#039; clothes are<strong> damp</strong>... they were splashing <em>water</em> on each other with their <em>oars</em> under the <em>sun</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-12-2007(5): The <em>row of penguins</em> came in wet from playing in the water and are slipping about in the front row, causing a commotion. Someone has the spotlight operator shine the light on them. Now, the <em>spotlit row of penguins</em> (see the <em>sun</em> above them?) is no longer wet - just a bit <em>damp</em>. You can still see their<strong> damp</strong> swim trunks dripping up by the stage.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 11-1-2009(4): <em>Rowing in the sun</em> helps to evaporate <em>water</em> from splashes a little, but the deck will still feel<strong> damp</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(4): After the <em>Star Wars</em> movie, the horny ones clear out, leaving the employees to clean the <em>movie theater</em> floor,<strong> damp</strong> with who knows what. Not wanting to touch anything, the employees throw <em>water</em> on the floor and open the ceiling to let the <em>sun</em> dry it up (see <a href="../1785">row</a> (#1785 並).
