heisig: "Just as the word <b>evening</b> adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word &quot;night,&quot; so the kanji for <b>evening</b> takes the ordinary looking <i>moon</i> in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame). The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji. SIMPLE In the evening, the crescent moon hangs in the sky."

## Heisig story:

Just as the word <b>evening</b> adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word &quot;night,&quot; so the kanji for <b>evening</b> takes the ordinary looking <i>moon</i> in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame).

## Premitive:

The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji. SIMPLE In the evening, the crescent moon hangs in the sky.

So to make this<strong> evening</strong> image more poetic, we show not just the moon but also a mysterious cloud partly obscuring the moon. ** Maybe the cloud is actually vapor from someone&#039;s SEKI (cough), YUU never know! [SEKI, yuu].
