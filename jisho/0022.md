heisig: What else can the word <b>sparkle</b> suggest if not a diamond? And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature <i>sun</i>. This kanji is a picture of a tiny <i>sun</i> in three places (that is, "everywhere"), to give the sense of something that <b>sparkles</b> on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole.
