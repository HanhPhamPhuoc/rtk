heisig: "What else can the word <b>sparkle</b> suggest if not a diamond? And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature <i>sun</i>. This kanji is a picture of a tiny <i>sun</i> in three places (that is, &quot;everywhere&quot;), to give the sense of something that <b>sparkles</b> on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole."

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 13-1-2010(12): Wow - Has been ages since I got this character up in a review, I failed it because I thought of a different kanji. Anyway this Kanji has a lot to do with crystals and crystal structure 液晶 liquid crystal, 結晶 crystal, crystallization, crystallisation, 結晶学 crystallography. So the connotation of &#039;diamond&#039; is really good - maintain that and it will easily let you fall back to its main usage of crystals.
