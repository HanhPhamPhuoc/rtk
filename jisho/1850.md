## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 29-3-2007(102): In Sydney we occasionally get exotic birds. You first notice a <strong>colouring</strong> in a <em>tree</em>. You look more carefully and you make out the <em>shape</em> of a bird (here represented by its <em>claws</em>).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 18-12-2006(77): <em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter changes the<strong> coloring</strong> of her skin to camouflage tones and perches herself in a <em>tree</em> like a <em>vulture</em> waiting for her pray.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 25-1-2008(75): <strong>warning:</strong> There is a mistake in the 4th edition, that&#039;s not a <em>fledgling</em> primitive on the left. It should be obvious but somehow I didn&#039;t notice it when I learned that one yesterday. v__v.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 14-4-2008(51): A little kid about age 3 is<strong> coloring</strong> something that his teacher can&#039;t quite make out. It&#039;s just kind of a blob... an unknown shape. She asks, &quot;What&#039;s that?&quot; Of course, the child expects the teacher to know what it is and is offended that she didn&#039;t recognize what the shape/blob was. &quot;Don&#039;t you see it&#039;s a vulture in a tree!?&quot; Obviously very upset by this, the child&#039;s next drawing is of the vulture flying down from the tree and pecking the teacher to death.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 23-11-2009(45): When<strong> coloring</strong> something in you <em>grab</em> the crayon of choice to fill in the <em>shape</em>s.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 27-1-2008(16): Although it&#039;s<strong> coloring</strong> attempts to camouflage it, you can see the shape of a vulture in that tree.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/deadweigh">deadweigh</a>] 12-10-2010(14): When<strong> coloring</strong> something in, you <em> <a href="../v4/2090">grab</a> (#2090 采)</em>采 - like the <em>vulture</em>, the <em>tree</em> - the crayon of choice to fill in the <em>shape</em>s. (meolox) <a href="../v4/1714">coloring</a> (#1714 彩) vs <a href="../v4/1753">color</a> (#1753 色).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 26-11-2012(9): The <em>bird claw</em>ed to the top of the <em>tree</em> to <a href="../v4/2090">grab</a> (#2090 采) a view the<strong> coloring</strong> of <em>shapes</em> in its 4 primary colors (bird eyes have a higher density of rods and cones to see well from flight; furthermore, they have 4 types of cones, which lets them see 4 primary colors as opposed to human&#039;s 3. They see more colors than we do, including ultra-violet light to see through clouds.) --all the better to <em>grab</em> at the <em>shape</em> of its prey. (don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/1753">color</a> (#1753 色)).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 5-2-2008(9): <em>Bruce Lee</em> sits beneath a <em>tree</em><strong> coloring</strong> a<strong> coloring</strong> book with his kids. Overhead, a <em>vulture</em> in the <em>tree</em> sees the kids as easy prey and tries to attack the kids. A spectacular man-vs-beast kung-fu fight ensues.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 18-8-2009(8): The<strong> coloring</strong> of the <em>vulture</em> in that <em>tree</em> is ridiculous. Remember when you bought a pack of three <em>Play-Doh</em> colors and they were those ridiculous bright pastels--this bird is EXACTLY those colors.
