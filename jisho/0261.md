heisig: "An <b>emperor</b>, as we all know, is a ruler - something like a <i>king</i> but higher in status. The <i>white bird</i> perched above the <i>king</i>, elevating him to <b>imperial</b> heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that <i>white birds</i> have long done in folklore throughout the world."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 4-10-2007(151): Ancient Rome had<strong> Emperor</strong>s instead of Kings, and they wore white robes. Thus an<strong> emperor</strong> is a <em>king</em> in <em>white</em>. (make sure you picture a roman<strong> emperor</strong> not a japanese one and you&#039;ll be ok).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 13-10-2008(63): I don&#039;t think the Japanese would be happy if their<strong> emperor</strong> was a <em>white king</em>...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lucianreign">lucianreign</a>] 6-12-2006(50): The white dove descended on the king and he was promoted to<strong> emperor</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg">johanvg</a>] 14-7-2006(24): An<strong> emperor</strong> is a holy king. In Japanese Shinto white is the holiest color.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vxnine">vxnine</a>] 7-12-2008(15): Whenever I think an<strong> Emperor</strong> I always think of<strong> Emperor</strong> Palpatine from Star Wars. He is the <em>king</em> of all the <em>white</em> stormtroopers.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 28-8-2007(10): The <strong>Burger King</strong> wanted to show off his new status as<strong> EMPEROR</strong> by wearing a hat made of fine quality <strong>cocaine</strong>. That&#039;s serious bling, son.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mrgrimm">mrgrimm</a>] 29-9-2009(8): The<strong> emperor</strong> is wiser (has more White hair) than the King.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 1-2-2011(7): In feudal Japan, white skin symbolizes nobility. While the peasants&#039; skin brown as they toil under the hot sun, Japan&#039;s <em>king</em>, the<strong> emperor</strong>, sits comfortably in his abode, keeping his skin a porcelain <em>white</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sleepyhead">Sleepyhead</a>] 4-2-2009(4): <em>White</em> people have <em>kings</em>. The Japanese has an<strong> emperor</strong> instead.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/farpung">farpung</a>] 24-11-2011(3): An<strong> emperor</strong> is a <em>white</em> (=pure) <em>king</em>, just as a <a href="../133">spring</a> (#133 泉) is white (=pure) water. In Japanese Shinto white is the purest color.
