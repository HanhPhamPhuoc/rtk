## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 2-11-2007(65): A little one is eating a<strong> domburi</strong> while standing over, looking down into, a WELL. He drops it, and it falls down &amp; down until it looks like nothing more than a DROP, landing at the bottom of the well!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(24): I <em>drop</em> a<strong> domburi</strong> down into the <em>well</em> for the goblin living there.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 4-9-2009(13): (thx mantixen) I DROP<strong> Domburi</strong> into the WELL to feed Sadako (Ring).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 5-11-2009(4): A <strong>donburi</strong> is rice bowl, with <em>drops</em> of food (other than rice) and garnish on top. The steep-sided shape of the typical <strong>donburi</strong> bowl is depicted in the kanji as a <em>well</em>, which is not a bad comparison.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 25-3-2010(3): Pictograph of a Yoshinoya beef bowl with a drop of raw egg in the center (thanks Chadoro_K).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 15-10-2010(1): 丼勘定 , 丼物 , 牛丼 , 丼 , 親子丼 , 鰻丼 <a href="../v4/2884">domburi</a> (#2884 丼) どん, どんぶり ... Parts: 井 , 丶 ... Story: Too many <strong>Donburi</strong> and you will have many <em>Drops</em> in your <em>Well</em>, so to speak. Eat some veggies, dammit.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chadokoro_K">Chadokoro_K</a>] 24-10-2007(1): WELL + DROP ** Hint: ...and I like to play with my Oyako<strong> DOMBURI</strong> by smooshing the sides up into a WELL-shape around the yummy golden DROP of egg yolk in the center.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinsoog">Hinsoog</a>] 22-3-2012(): This happens a lot with どんぶり/domburi(like in カツ丼 /かつどん), where it looks like a big bowl of some fancy food, and when you dig into it, it&#039;s just a <em>drop</em> of the delicious-looking food on top of a whole <em>well</em>&#039;s worth of rice hiding in the bowl below the top. They are still pretty awesome, but this makes the story more memorable.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wtfhax">wtfhax</a>] 4-2-2012(): Donburi(6th version - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donburi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donburi</a> as well) is a bowl of rice with whatever can be caught in the little drop in the bottom of the well.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 28-1-2012(): He said the Shirako<strong> domburi</strong> tasted bad and threw it in the well. I think you can see it there at the bottom.
