## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 24-1-2008(129): The country folk and and the city folk mingle at the<strong> outskirts</strong> of town, just past the city walls. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 12-3-2007(75): The city walls mark the<strong> outskirts</strong> of the inner city, where it begins to mingle with the suburbs. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 1-1-2009(52): The city folks don&#039;t like to <em>mingle</em> with people from the<strong> outskirts</strong>. That&#039;s why they built such big <em>city walls</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 20-8-2009(16): Many of the girls from the <em>slums</em> come to <em>mingle</em> near the<strong> outskirts</strong> of the slums--in the hopes that they can find a more wealthy guy to get them out of the hell hole. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/violetize">violetize</a>] 7-8-2009(8): (primitive city walls - slum. See residence 1841 - scotty28) On the <strong>outskirts</strong> of the community is the <em>slum</em>, where you dare not <em>mingle</em> with the slum dwellers - it&#039;s too dangerous. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>] 18-11-2009(6): Mister Burns never mingles in stuff on the<strong> outskirts</strong> of his domain. He feels too good to mingle with the<strong> outskirts</strong>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/henroski">henroski</a>] 6-8-2008(6): MINGLING withOUT-SKIRTS is not permitted within the perimeter of the CITY WALLS. For that sort of frolic, you must go to the seedy<strong> OUTSKIRTS</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DeKleft">DeKleft</a>] 4-12-2007(6): (from cbogart) The city walls mark the<strong> outskirts</strong> of the inner city, where the outsiders like to mingle. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scotty28">scotty28</a>] 2-8-2009(4): (primitive city walls - slum. See residence 1841) You dare not mingle pasts the<strong> outskirts</strong> of the slum city walls. I mean, mingling can be fun, but past the<strong> outskirts</strong> you are likley to be mugged or worse. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peacemik">peacemik</a>] 12-9-2008(4): The <em>city walls</em> used to demarcate where the city ended and the<strong> outskirts</strong> started. But now the city has grown beyond its walls and <em>mingles</em> with the<strong> outskirts</strong>.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/郊外">郊外</a>   (こうがい),   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/近郊">近郊</a>   (きんこう): suburbs,<strong> outskirts</strong>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/近郊都市">近郊都市</a>   (きんこうとし): neighboring towns   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/近郊農業">近郊農業</a>   (きんこうのうぎょう): urban agriculture   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/首都圏近郊緑地保全法">首都圏近郊緑地保全法</a>   (しゅとけんきんこうりょくちほぜんほう): Law for the Conservation of Green Belts Around the National Capital Region.
