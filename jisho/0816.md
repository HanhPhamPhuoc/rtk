## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 3-11-2005(284): I imagine an<strong> interment</strong> as a funeral. At this funeral it&#039;s an open casket, and the dead body (death) is holding flowers with both of its hands.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 2-10-2007(74): During the<strong> interment</strong> ceremony, the grandchildren placed <em>flowers</em> over the <em>dead</em> body while the widow sat praying with <em>two hands</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 9-10-2010(36): During<strong> interment</strong>, flowers are placed above <em>death</em>, while <em>two hands</em> from the netherworld are pulling from below.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/humpolec">humpolec</a>] 11-11-2008(20): We see <em>Death</em> himself standing at a funeral. This time he&#039;s not holding his scythe, but he has <em>flowers</em> in both hands.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vertigo959">vertigo959</a>] 6-10-2008(13): I used to confuse 亡 and 死 in this kanji, so I use the image of 死神 (shinigami, or death god) to help remember the right element.--- At this<strong> interment</strong> funeral, underneath the <em>flowers</em> on top of the grave, the <em>death god</em> ( 死神 ）, is descending towards the underworld, lowering the coffin with <em>both hands</em>. ソウ <a href="midori://search?text=葬式。葬る">葬式。葬る</a> .

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 30-4-2008(13): At the<strong> interment</strong>, there are so many flowers brought for the death of a pair of hands (maybe a couple of those self-animated hands from the Addams Family). Note the difference with FRAME 179 “bury”. While bury has a generic sense,<strong> interment</strong> refers to the “ritual placing of a corpse into a grave”.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 27-12-2009(10): Visualize this story: At an open casket funeral, <em>flowers</em> are placed on the <em>dead</em> as he lay in the casket with his <em>two hands</em> crossed on his chest.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 14-1-2008(9): You&#039;re havin a nightmare about an<strong> interment</strong>. You are throwing <em>flowers</em> at a casket, wondering whose<strong> interment</strong> it is, when suddenly <em>Death</em> appears and pushes you with <em>both hands</em> into the casket.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu">kiisu</a>] 27-3-2008(4): At an<strong> interment</strong>/funeral we offer flowers to death with two hands hoping to ease the path of the interred.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 13-11-2009(3): In<strong> interment</strong>, when laying out the corpse, put <em>flowers</em> in <em>Death</em>&#039;s clasped <em>two hands</em>. (feldrave, thanks for the idea of &quot;death him/herself&quot;! Gotta keep deceased out of this kanji!).
