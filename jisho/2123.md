## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 15-10-2006(181): The skunk here is Pepe LePew of Looney Tunes fame. He&#039;s a very<strong> sociable</strong> skunk, as far as skunks go, but instead of having a &quot;heart of gold&quot; he has a heart of silver (since he always finishes second in the game of love).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 9-11-2005(89): The skunk here is Pepe LePew of Looney Tunes fame. He&#039;s a very<strong> sociable</strong> skunk, as far as skunks go, but instead of having a &quot;heart of gold&quot; he has a heart of silver.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 23-6-2008(62): (コン) Skunk and silver appear together in a few kanji so I combined them to make a <em>silver skunk</em> character. This skunk, due to a random fluke, is not black and white, but actually silver colored. Which means this skunk can pass, say for, a cat (aka Over the Hedge). When the skunk realized the odd coloring wasn&#039;t a curse but actually a blessing, it realized in it&#039;s <em>heart </em>that it could be<strong> sociable</strong> with all sorts of animals that normally would run away from smelly skunks.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-7-2007(18): The skunk is very<strong> sociable</strong> at the party, telling everyone all about his <em>silver</em> <em>heart</em>. // Primitive: top left: <em>skunk</em> = a skunk <em>clawing</em> at a <em>sow</em>. The 3rd claw gets broken.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mentat_kgs">mentat_kgs</a>] 19-7-2008(14): I&#039;m using the top of the kanji as a lawyer: The lawyer is nothing but a skunk dressed in a silver suit. Also lawyers have no heart, they only fake it to be<strong> sociable</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 17-6-2009(10): Pepe LePew is indeed a<strong> sociable</strong> skunk, but the reason he has a heart of silver rather than gold is because he&#039;s nothing but a horndog who wants to stick his skunk penis into anything, regardless of species.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a>] 9-3-2007(9): This<strong> sociable</strong> skunk has a silver heart!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(6): Looks like the upper side is an extremely rare kanji of its own, 貇 (also written 豤), meaning &quot;to devour&quot; (from &quot;animal bite mark&quot;), and is used to mean &quot;deep&quot; as an element. As the true etymology is too unwieldy (艮 is not really &quot;silver&quot; for starters), let it be deep like the bite of a wereskunk (skunk shot with silver bullets). One is<strong> sociable</strong> when one feels for others deeply in one&#039;s heart.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 7-1-2006(6): Note : the skunk primitive is the chinese &quot;badger&quot; radical. Mnemonic device : note how both <em>sow</em> and <em>skunk</em> have the same number of strokes. The last two strokes of sow (the sow&#039;s tits) have become the skunk&#039;s pair of musk glands (second and third strokes).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 14-1-2010(5): <em>Skunks</em> are <em>silver</em>y striped or streaked (not mean streaked). Therefore they are not <em>heart</em>less and are indeed quite<strong> sociable</strong> - provided you don&#039;t upset them! Note: <strong>skunk</strong> = <em>claw + (k)not</em> (see <a href="../v4/1049">not</a> (#1049 勿)) with last last stroke of <em>claw</em> sharing 1st stroke of <em>(k)not</em>. STORY: When a skunk wants you to &quot;get knotted&quot; (Brit English for &quot;go away&quot;), it does <em>not</em> need to resort to using its <em>claws</em>.
