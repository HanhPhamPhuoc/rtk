## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Reikon">Reikon</a>] 4-8-2007(223): People at<strong> Universal</strong> Studios wait in rows so long that the sun goes down.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-12-2006(57): To me, <em>row</em> is way too close to <a href="../v4/812">file</a> (#812 列), so I&#039;m adopting Fab&#039;s meaning of <em>rowboat</em> from the previous frame.<strong> Universal</strong> Studios went through a number of logo animations before settling on the one they are most famous for: the letters<strong> UNIVERSAL</strong> orbiting the Earth. One of the most ridiculous of these involved a man <em>rowing</em> himself in a boat around the <em>sun</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/redskatz">redskatz</a>] 6-4-2009(35): It is a <strong>universal</strong> human desire to sit in <em>rows</em> to watch the <em>sun</em> go down.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 1-7-2009(22): If every planet lined up in a row with the sun there would be a<strong> universal</strong> solar eclipse.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 18-9-2007(12): The entrance to<strong> Universal</strong> Studio&#039;s movies has a <em>row of penguins</em> marching around the <em>Sun</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 25-4-2011(8): This kanji actually means generally or widely. It is a generally accepted practice in Japan to sit in rowboats to watch the sun go down.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 27-2-2008(8): This means<strong> universal</strong>, such as habitual, usual, general. STORY: A<strong> UNIVERSAL</strong>LY accepted fact about cosmology: when the moon LINES UP with the SUN you can USUALLY see a solar eclipse from Earth.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 11-1-2009(7): It is <strong>universally</strong> accepted that the men on <em>Viking Longboats</em> would row from <em>sun</em> up until <em>sun</em> down. See <a href="../v4/1785">row</a> (#1785 並).
