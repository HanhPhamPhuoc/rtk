## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 20-7-2007(208): Water flows down to<strong> destroy</strong> the march of fire.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 26-10-2007(98): Use a <em>water</em> cannon to<strong> destroy</strong> a line of <em>march</em>ing <em>fire</em> monsters. I keep mixing this one up with <a href="../v4/167">disaster</a> (#167 災) and <a href="../v4/400">demolition</a> (#400 壊). Remember, you<strong> DESTROY</strong> monsters (think of the Godzilla movie &quot;Destroy All Monsters!&quot;). Fires and floods are natural DISASTERs. And DEMOLITION is something you carefully do while wearing protective garments. (vaguely based on stefanot&#039;s balrog story).

TROY which comes from<strong> desTROY</strong>! They came across the WATER with the horse, secretly MARCHED in the city and BURNED the city down.<strong> DESTROY</strong>: The march of flames on troy. . . 絶滅 ぜつめつ　－　Extinction RTK2:　メツ 滅亡 めつぼう(destruction) 滅ぶ ほろぶ　－　To collapse, go under, be<strong> destroy</strong>ed.　.
