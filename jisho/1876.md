## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 23-12-2006(200): In venice, the <em>boat</em> used by the <em>courts</em> to transport criminals is a<strong> rowboat</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 28-2-2007(98): Courts in olden times would often punish convicts by sentencing them to a life of being the rower crew for large<strong> rowboat</strong> ships (there were no engines or boilers back then)... Yo ho, Yo ho.... 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 11-10-2007(35): &quot;Row, row, row your <em>boat</em>.....&quot;. Imagine someone who goes to <em>court</em>, claiming they wrote this song first. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/foodcubes">foodcubes</a>] 7-11-2010(14): Sometimes abstract imagery works very well. Imagine someone showing up to <strong>court</strong> in a <strong>rowboat</strong>. Really imagine them rowing it across the floor and you won&#039;t forget this Kanji. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 9-10-2005(13): There&#039;s a phrase in English to &quot;send you up the river,&quot; meaning to be sent to jail. If you think of this then all you have to do is picture the courts sending you up the river in a boat... a<strong> rowboat</strong> to be precise. If it helps, you can also think of your state then as being &quot;up the creek without a paddle.&quot;. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 13-12-2008(10): &quot;row row row your <em>boat</em> gently down the <em>court</em>&quot;. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 10-3-2010(6): After the <em>Titanic</em> hit the iceberg, the crew had to determine how to allocate the<strong> rowboat</strong>s (lifeboats). They setup a <em>court</em> to decide the matter. The presiding judge announced the following: &quot;Women and children first. Then first class passengers.&quot; I guess Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) won&#039;t be making it off the Titanic after all. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 27-2-2007(6): To be &quot;sent up the river&quot; means to be sent to jail. This <em>boat</em> being used by the <em>court</em> to send you up the river is a <strong>rowboat</strong>. Maybe a slave galley? 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thomasritz">thomasritz</a>] 5-7-2009(5): Oliver <strong>Kahn</strong> rudert mit seinem <em>Boot</em> zum <em>Gerichtshof</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 7-5-2008(4): If you&#039;ve ever seen the Hitchcock movie Lifeboat, you have the perfect scene for this kanji: people holding a court to codemn the German on their little<strong> rowboat</strong>.
