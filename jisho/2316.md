## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 21-5-2007(65): The greatest<strong> fabrication</strong> ever told was that God made the <em>water </em> and the <em>earth</em> in only one <em>day</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 6-6-2009(20): This kanji should mean <strong>black soil</strong>. It is is used for Buddha&#039;s death and nirvana ( 涅槃 (ねはん)). Story:<strong> Fabrication</strong> of black soil. Use <em>water</em> to wash away other colours and and dry it in the <em>sun</em> (<em>sun</em> over <em>soil</em>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 20-11-2008(9): It is a<strong> fabrication</strong> that god made WATER, SUN and EARTH. It was already there when he came. (thx to ikmys!).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 23-7-2010(4): The <em>soil</em> will turn into <strong>black soil</strong> after you pour <em>water</em> on it and it sits all <em>day</em> under the <em>sun</em>. This kanji means <strong>black soil</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 2-3-2012(1): <strong>Black soil</strong> is nirvana for plants. Just add some <em>water</em> and <em>sun</em> to the <em>soil</em> and you&#039;re all set.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 28-11-2009(1): Using WATER to mix mud, SUN to dry things out, and placing the objects on the SOIL, one can make a<strong> FABRICATION</strong> of an army to disuade the enemy.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nadiatims">nadiatims</a>] 24-6-2009(1): The biblical story of the creation of the sun,water and soil is the greatest<strong> fabrication</strong> ever told, but in NETs (NETSU) in a lot of suckers.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 14-1-2009(1): These pots are<strong> fabrication</strong>s of kiln made ceramics. Using WATER I am able to dissolve this SUN baked DIRT. What are you trying to pull?
