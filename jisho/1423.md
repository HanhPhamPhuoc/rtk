7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 13-5-2008(6): For this one, piggybacking off of the sign of the hare / easter bunny mnemonic that people have used for the last frames, I&#039;ll use the <em>Bad Easter Bunny</em> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnXR5Baq0X8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnXR5Baq0X8</a>), who hides a <em>blade</em> under his right ear.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 15-1-2010(3): PRIMITIVE (from RSH): <em>Receipt</em> + <em>stamp</em> = <strong>letter opener</strong> -- but the stamp becomes a <em>dagger</em> whenever the letter opener is on top. KEYWORD: I use <strong>stay</strong> (as in Chinese) instead of <strong>detain</strong> to avoid confusion with <a href="../654">arrest</a> <span class="index">(#654 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/拘">拘</a>)</span>. STORY: To improve your knowledge in your <em>field</em>, you want to <strong>stay</strong> at a university abroad (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/留学">留学</a>  ). When you get the acceptance letter, you use a fine <em>letter opener</em> to mark the occasion.
