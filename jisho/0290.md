## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 2-3-2008(350): I can&#039;t believe no one has used this one yet: <strong>Copper</strong> is <em>metal</em> which looks almost <em>the same</em> as <em>gold</em>. Really, look it up on Wikipedia, it&#039;s yellow and it&#039;s shiny (atleast in some compounds)!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 4-6-2006(51): <strong>Copper</strong> is an excellent conductor. In other words, it&#039;s a <em>metal</em> for which the voltage is the <em>same</em> everywhere. That&#039;s why it&#039;s used for wires.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg">sethg</a>] 29-1-2009(22): A <em>metal</em> that looks the <em>same</em> as <em>gold</em> is<strong> COPPER</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 13-11-2007(14): <strong>Copper</strong> and <em>gold</em> are in the <em>same</em> column of the periodic table. And now what am I going to do for 銀 <a href="../v4/1459">silver</a> (#1459 銀)????

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sevenhelmets">Sevenhelmets</a>] 27-7-2008(10): <strong>Copper</strong> is a metal, the <em>same</em> as <em>gold</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Foddy">Foddy</a>] 14-11-2007(5): Every<strong> copper</strong> with his <em>metal</em> badge and uniform looks the <em>same</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rmontagner">rmontagner</a>] 11-7-2012(3): <strong>Copper</strong> can look the same as gold...どう .

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nerdlass">nerdlass</a>] 6-3-2011(3): GOLD is not the SAME as<strong> copper</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/seijitsu">seijitsu</a>] 18-2-2013(2): <strong>Copper</strong> is metal which looks almost the <em>same</em> as <em>gold</em>, and is an excellent conductor. The voltage is the <em>same</em> everywhere.
