heisig: "Since it is very hard to read by the <i>fireplace</i> without going blind from the flickering of the flames or burning up from the heat, our ancestors invented a way to <i>nail</i> down a bit of that <i>fire</i>, just enough to light up the text of their evening newspapers and no more. Voilà! The <b>lamp</b>."

These human<strong> lamp</strong>s lit up the massive <em>road</em> with burning corpses as a reminder not to lose against the Romans. Thanks Latin 3!

It also helps me imagining this in a pictographic manner... the fire being a man walking up to a<strong> lamp</strong> on a pole (the line represents the bottom of the &quot;lamp shade&quot; who&#039;s full image is out of view). His arm is reaching up to turn the<strong> lamp</strong> on. See what I mean?
