## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 22-5-2008(242): My<strong> nickname</strong> is &quot;No Lips&quot;. Yep, I shouldn&#039;t have put my <em>mouth</em> on that <em>bear trap</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tony563">tony563</a>] 7-5-2006(68): When certain<strong> nickname</strong> snares to people&#039;s mouths, they will call you that way forever.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 8-5-2007(44): Also used in code, signal, password, etc. A <strong>password</strong> is the <strong>code</strong> you must <em>mouthe</em> to release the <em>snare</em> so you may enter safely.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Talka">Talka</a>] 8-9-2007(16): My name is Mouthamus Snarica. But my<strong> nickname</strong> is just Mouth Snare. (Hell, worked for me).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow">cornrow</a>] 7-12-2008(13): Her<strong> nickname</strong> was <em>MOUTH</em> SNARE. I won&#039;t tell you how she got it.
