3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 3-4-2011(28): TIP: This is used for string instruments, <strong>NOT</strong> bow &amp; arrow. STORY: The greatest master of the violin <em>bow</em> and<strong> bowstring</strong> was the <em>mysterious</em> Paganini... 弦 [つる].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-5-2007(25): It was always (and still is) a bit <em>mysterious</em> to me just what type of<strong> bowstring</strong> was supposed to be used on Chewbacca&#039;s laser bolt cross<em>bow</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 14-11-2007(18): Legolas asks Gandalf to conjure him a new<strong> bowstring</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peacemik">peacemik</a>] 7-8-2008(7): Small addition to cjon256&#039;s story to give me a more tangible image: A <em>bow</em> with a <em>mysterious</em> invisible<strong> bowstring</strong> that makes beautiful sounds like a stringed instrument. [Be careful when building your image; the &quot;sound&quot; primitive does not appear in this kanji.] 弦楽器 (げんがっき): stringed instruments 弦 (げん、つる):<strong> bowstring</strong>, string (of stringed instrument), chord (of a circle) 管弦楽団 (かんげんがくだん): orchestra 調弦 (ちょうげん): tuning.
