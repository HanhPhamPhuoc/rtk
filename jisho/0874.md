## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 30-11-2007(186): The calligrapher&#039;s <em>brush</em> is moving down a <em>column</em> of a script, in<strong> rhythm</strong> with his meditation. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 1-9-2007(47): The army COLUMN walked to the<strong> RHYTHM</strong> made by the drummer using a cool BRUSH like drum stick. Picturing the brush as a drum stick is not difficult if you&#039;ve seen such a thing in jazz videos. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 5-6-2009(38): Picture a school of studious calligraphers. All their <em>brushes</em> are moving up and down the <em>columns</em> at the same time, in beautiful<strong> rhythm</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CSBarnes">CSBarnes</a>] 30-12-2008(22): <em>Brush</em> Hero: The latest in<strong> rhythm</strong> games, you have to use your <em>brush</em> in<strong> rhythm</strong> to the music as the <em>column</em> of strokes move down the screen. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(20): [+woel] <em>Lance Armstrong</em> is riding here while <em>brush</em>ing his teeth. This is actually one of the secrets to his success - he sets his<strong> rhythm</strong> by <em>brush</em>ing his teeth, and following that<strong> rhythm</strong> on the pedals. In-out-in-out-in-out; right-left-right-left-right-left. You can try it sometime if you really want to bring your<strong> rhythm</strong> to a good pace. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ambassadog">ambassadog</a>] 13-7-2009(13): I always <em>go</em> to see jazz drummers play, they use <em>brushes</em> instead of sticks, and are among the most <strong>rhythmic</strong> drummers in music. <em>Go</em> man, <em>go</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988">pageturner1988</a>] 18-12-2007(11): Most compounds using this kanji use it in the sense of a law (e.g.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/軍律">軍律</a>   - martial law and   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/刑律">刑律</a>   - criminal law). So I&#039;m going to use <strong>law</strong> as the keyword. I&#039;m going to the palace to stop the <strong>law</strong> from being written down (brushed). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 3-5-2007(8): Imagine a calligraphy performance done to music. They make <em>lines</em> with their <em>brush</em> in<strong> rhythm</strong> to the music. UPDATE: Look at this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt13tjuKHUQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt13tjuKHUQ</a>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ji_suss">Ji_suss</a>] 5-12-2008(7): Go brush! Go brush! Go, Go, Go brush! Go brush! Go brush! Go, Go, Go brush! 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 7-2-2007(7): <em>The Flash</em> has an extremely fast<strong> rhythm</strong> when <em>brushing</em> kanji.
