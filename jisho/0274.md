## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a>] 18-4-2007(191): The king of the Oysters produces special Vermillion<strong> pearl</strong>s!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/quety101">quety101</a>] 25-1-2008(79): King Vermillion is a little queer and likes to wear<strong> pearl</strong> necklaces.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 19-1-2008(58): Usually <strong>pearls</strong> are white, or black. Only a very rare, very expensive<strong> pearl</strong> is <em>vermillion</em> colored. Such a <strong>pearl</strong> would be fit for a <em>king</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 1-2-2008(57): The <em>king</em> made everyone turn a bright shade of <em>vermilion</em> when he showed up wearing a<strong> PEARL</strong> necklace. (Tweaked for positioning purposes. Thanks ngoli1).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 10-7-2008(23): I gave the princess a <strong>pearl</strong> necklace and the <a href="../v4/255">king</a> (#255 王) turned a bright shade of <a href="../v4/221">vermilion</a> (#221 朱) when he saw it on her.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MrPhil">MrPhil</a>] 1-4-2008(13): <strong>Scarlett</strong> Johansson &quot;Girl with a<strong> Pearl</strong> Earring&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 29-7-2006(11): Oysters don&#039;t have red blood, and their<strong> pearl</strong>s are as colourless as their flesh, but imagine if<strong> pearl</strong>s grew inside <em>kings.</em> The resulting<strong> pearl</strong> would be as bloody <em>vermillion</em> as his flesh and its retrieval would be accompanied by yet more <em>vermillion</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 18-5-2009(7): In ancient Japan,<strong> pearl</strong> divers would have to cut the<strong> pearl</strong> out by hand. If it was from a crusty old <em>king</em> oyster, it would be a difficult task, so a fresh one would often be stained <em>vermillion</em> with the diver&#039;s blood. [note: a<strong> pearl</strong> is not a jewel, but it is something close].

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 27-8-2010(4): KINGS shouldn&#039;t wear jewels. People&#039;s face turned VERMILLION when the KING showed up with a<strong> PEARL</strong> necklace.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/washburn1981">washburn1981</a>] 16-5-2010(4): Only the <em>king</em> owns <em>vermillion</em> <strong>pearls</strong>.
