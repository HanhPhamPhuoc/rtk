## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fredde79">fredde79</a>] 2-9-2007(320): Think of the term from televison &quot;suitable for all audiences&quot; to get the sense of the word. What program could be more<strong> suitable</strong> for the whole family than the &quot;<em>antiques</em> <em>road</em>(show)&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 26-4-2008(75): It&#039;s an <em>antique</em>, but it&#039;s still<strong> suitable</strong> for the <em>road</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/OrangeNut">OrangeNut</a>] 11-1-2009(54): Even today, some <em>antique</em> Roman <em>roads</em> are<strong> suitable</strong> for travel.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chrislewisca">chrislewisca</a>] 13-9-2006(48): That old thing in your attic might be<strong> suitable</strong> to be shown on the <em>Antiques</em> <em>Road</em>show.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret">Wosret</a>] 7-6-2008(17): That <strong>antique road</strong> isn&#039;t<strong> suitable</strong> for travel.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 22-9-2006(13): Anybody who has lived in Japan knows that the ROAD is a perfectly<strong> SUITABLE</strong> place to ditch your old ANTIQUES when you no longer need them. In my neighbourhood people dump ANTIQUE washing machines, stereos, guitars, tv&#039;s, all sorts of stuff right out on the side of the ROAD.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 9-12-2007(11): Marty McFly and the Doc are trapped back in time. They need to find a place where the De Lorean can reach 88 mph. They find an <em>antique</em> <em>road</em>, it&#039;s a little bumpy but<strong> suitable</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 14-9-2008(9): It is not<strong> suitable</strong> to place <em>an antique</em> (something <em>old</em>, fragile and valuable) <em>standing</em> on <em>the road</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/maxthornbow">maxthornbow</a>] 22-5-2012(5): It&#039;s very <strong>suitable</strong> for an <em>antique</em> to be left on the <em>road</em>. Throw the old stuff away!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamesgnicholas">jamesgnicholas</a>] 16-8-2012(4): The antique road show is<strong> suitable</strong> for everyone.
