## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-4-2007(308): This guy has an<strong> attitude</strong> problem – lots of <em>ability</em>, but his <em>heart</em>&#039;s not in it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/redskatz">redskatz</a>] 9-4-2009(113): Having a good <strong>attitude</strong> means believing in your <em>heart</em> that you have the <em>ability</em> to do anything - like memorizing more than 2000 kanji, for example.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 16-10-2006(13): If you had the <em>ability</em> to read people&#039;s <em>hearts</em> (especially women&#039;s hearts), it&#039;d be so easy to find out why they have such an<strong> attitude</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/morganandrew">morganandrew</a>] 12-4-2010(11): &quot;It&#039;s an<strong> attitude</strong> problem I&#039;m afraid,&quot; says the teacher at parents&#039; evening. &quot;He has the ABILITY to be a great but his HEART is not in it.&quot; &quot;What should we do?&quot; says the concerned parent. &quot;Let&#039;s try this HEART, shall we?&quot; says the coach, handing over a HEART that will give their child a better<strong> attitude</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 1-4-2008(8): Hint: Carebears (trading fire for heart-power).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 13-3-2011(3): <em>Ability</em> plus <em>heart</em> makes a good<strong> attitude</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 26-3-2008(3): This kanji is used often to mean &quot;on purpose&quot; or &quot;specially just for you.&quot; STORY: Someone has a lot of ABILITY but no HEART which makes him do 変態 type things on PURPOSE. ty katsuo.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 28-1-2008(3): It takes great ability to change the<strong> attitude</strong> of your heart, say, in become a more positive person.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sekiei">sekiei</a>] 10-1-2013(2): Couldn&#039;t resist using <em>Po</em> again (<a href="../2003">bear</a> (#2003 熊)). At first, because he had no <em>ability</em> in kung fu, everyone had an<strong> attitude</strong> towards him. But after he started believing in himself, Shifu had a change of <em>heart</em> and his<strong> attitude</strong> towards Po changed. Also, Po eventually develops the right<strong> attitude</strong> and chooses to fight Tai Lung. His <em>ability</em> to trust in his own and his master&#039;s <em>heart</em> is what developed this positive<strong> attitude</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pgp27">pgp27</a>] 25-10-2009(2): He has an<strong> attitude</strong> problem, he puts his ELBOW in his plate, he eats too much MEAT, uses his SPOON and then mine, but his HEART is in the right place (i.e. at the bottom of the kanji).
