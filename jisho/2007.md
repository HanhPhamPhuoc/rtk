## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(196): The porn <strong>director</strong> has <em>one</em> big <em>mouth</em>. &quot;Don&#039;t bother putting your clothes on a <em>hanger</em>, just get started.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 27-7-2008(92): The<strong> director</strong> sticks a <em>clothes hanger</em> in each actor&#039;s <em>mouth</em> and hangs them from the <em>ceiling</em> until he needs them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaydwyrm">shaydwyrm</a>] 19-7-2007(69): I think of this one as a pictograph of a guy talking on one of those headsets with a microphone attached - he&#039;s <strong>directing</strong> a movie, so he has to be constantly in touch with everyone!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 24-5-2009(30): Every<strong> director</strong> is the <em>same</em>( 同じ ). But this<strong> director</strong>, this one, he&#039;s different.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 1-1-2006(21): This<strong> director</strong> is filming an ad for some washing powder. A bunch of kids are hanging from a clothes line, on <em>clothes hangers</em>. They aren&#039;t quiet and are making a lot of noise. Only one of them, at the center, is facing the camera and needs to deliver a line. The<strong> director</strong> becomes hysterical and using his megaphone yells at them &quot;SHUT UP! I WANT TO SEE ONLY <em>ONE OPEN MOUTH</em> !&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 16-3-2007(14): Alfred Hitchcock had 50 identical suits on his clothes hanger and one big cigar in his mouth.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 19-11-2009(9): Porn<strong> Director</strong>: &quot;<em>Clothes Hanger</em> Bangers, take <em>one!</em> Open your <em>mouth</em>, sweetie.&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 19-6-2006(7): The<strong> director</strong> is a sexist pig...if you want to be in his movie ... you need to put everything on the <em>clothes hangar</em> and put <em>one</em> <em>mouth</em> on.....

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 4-6-2009(6): Primitive: Quentin Tarantino. A film<strong> director</strong> with <em>one big mouth</em> and a huge wardrobe full of blood-stained business suits (from filming Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, among others), all hung neatly on <em>clothes hangers</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 23-5-2010(3): This<strong> DIRECTOR</strong> is the <em>SAME</em> person who, outside of the office, is an Opus Dei <em>MONK</em>. He arrives at his office in the morning still wearing his <em>HOODED HABIT</em>, takes it off, and hangs it on a <em>CLOTHES HANGER</em>. Then <em>SAME MOUTH</em> that only a little earlier chanted as <em>ONE</em> with other <em>MONKS</em> starts barking out orders. (BTW, this story is not <em>too</em> fanciful: among Opus Dei &quot;numeraries&quot; there are many<strong> director</strong>s of organizations. But no, they don&#039;t actually wear habits outside of work.).
