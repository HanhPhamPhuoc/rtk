8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 26-1-2010(3): <em>Vampires</em> are like pigs. They can&#039;t<strong> sweat</strong>. That&#039;s the real reason they don&#039;t go out in the sun. Too hot. They&#039;d have to constantly squirt some <em>water</em> on their face to stay cool.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 12-2-2013(2): Pocari<strong> Sweat</strong> is no better than <em>water</em> is, when you are <em>dry</em>. Unless you are an athlete it will just make you fat.
