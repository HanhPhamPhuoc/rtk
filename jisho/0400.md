## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 3-5-2007(410): If you stand too close to a<strong> DEMOLITION</strong> site, the dust might sting you like NEEDLES in your EYE and get your GARMENTs all dirty.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 16-10-2007(108): Since that needle eye thing turns up a lot, I turned it into Darth Vader. It kinda looks like him to me, with the eye being his metal mouth piece thing. So, Darth Vader swings his cape (his garment) demolishing a nearby building, leaving nothing but a pile of dirt.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lukearns">lukearns</a>] 2-4-2008(51): During<strong> demolition</strong>, <em>dirt</em> and debris can feel like <em>needles in your eyes</em> if you&#039;re not wearing ther proper <em>garments</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd">eightyd</a>] 8-7-2009(16): The dirt to the left is all that remains of the WTC on 9/11. On the right we have george bush wearing a perfectly clean and expensive suit/garment putting eyedrops in his eye to force an emotion over the victims of 9/11. He has to fake this emotion since 9/11 was a controlled<strong> demolition</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ew8049">ew8049</a>] 29-6-2008(15): The<strong> demolition</strong> expert doesn&#039;t want DIRT in his 10 EYES, so he covers them with a SCARF.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chucklol">chucklol</a>] 21-8-2010(8): During a<strong> demolition</strong>, <em>Dirt</em> flies everywhere like <em>needles</em>, good thing you are wearing your protective <em>goggles</em> and <em>garments</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 19-7-2008(8): 壊す 【こわす】 (v5s,vt) to break; to break down; (P). 壊れる 【こわれる】 (v1,vi) to be broken; to break; (P) This Kanzi means &quot;break,&quot; not something as huge as a<strong> demolition</strong> site, etc. Think about &quot;Break&quot; as in breaking a tool, toy, etc. STORY: Sweat shops in Asia are very severe, especially in the CLOTHING industry. If you BREAK a sowing machine, they stick the NEEDLE from the machine in your EYE and bury you in the DIRT wearing the CLOTHING you did not finish.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MikeNeko">MikeNeko</a>] 14-9-2008(7): This<strong> demolition</strong> is a bit odd - instead of a wrecking ball they are using a <em>ten</em> foot diameter giant <em>eye</em> swinging from the crane! I practically <em>soil</em>ed my <em>clothes</em> when it winked at me!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ji_suss">Ji_suss</a>] 3-9-2008(5): After the<strong> DEMOLITION</strong>, a gruesome scene: in the DIRT they discovered TEN MISSHAPEN EYES on a jacket (GARMENT). Guess they didn&#039;t clear out the building properly.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 19-10-2007(4): <strong>Demolition</strong> means to smash something down to particles of soil so small they&#039;ll pass through the eye of a needle. Wear <em>safety goggles</em> and proper <em>garments</em> to avoid injury. To remember when the eye primitive is sideways, I&#039;m trying a new primitive for it: &quot;safety goggles&quot;. (I keep forgetting the garment part. Hold onto the image of how dirty and dangerous<strong> demolition</strong> is and that you need <em>special clothes</em> and <em>safety goggles</em> to do it.).
