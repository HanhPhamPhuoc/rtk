## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-10-2007(35): Jimi Hendrix works as a <em>weather</em> forcaster in his <em>spare time</em>. Today he predicts a (purple)<strong> haze</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 7-2-2009(24): What a coincidence that work should give me <em>time off</em> only days that have <em>rain</em> or <strong>haze</strong> but no sun.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 2-6-2008(8): Rain, spare time: His <em>hobby</em> is jogging. As he crosses the hills surrounding Kyoto, he can see a<strong> haze</strong> hanging around the city. &quot;Well, let&#039;s hope it <em>rains</em> soon. That damn smog is bad for my health!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 14-3-2010(5): My <em>hobby</em> is landscape photography so I don&#039;t like it when the <em>weather</em> is <strong>hazy</strong>. Note: <a href="../1882">spare time</a> (#1882 暇) 暇 - 日 = 叚 so I suppose <em>hobby</em> is a diminutive of <em>spare time</em>. [叚 = <a href="../21466">Unicode-0x53da</a> (#21466 叚)].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 19-1-2009(5): What a coincidence that work should give me <em>time off</em> only days that have <em>rain</em> or<strong> haze</strong> but no sun.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 15-8-2011(2): 霞み , 朝霞市 , 霞ヶ関 , 霞む , <a href="../2779">haze</a> (#2779 霞) カ( 暇 ), かすみ, かすむ ... Parts: 雨 , 叚 ( 暇 - 日 ) (cf: 蝦夷地 <a href="../2881">ebisu</a> (#2881 夷), 暇 <a href="../1882">spare time</a> (#1882 暇),) ... Note: かすみ aslo written with 翳りの有る顔 <a href="../32755">Unicode-0x7ff3</a> (#32755 翳) ... Story: Jimi Hendrix works as a <em>weather</em> forcaster in his <em>spare time</em>. Today he predicts a (purple)<strong> haze</strong>. Actually it&#039;s <em>not just today</em>, it&#039;s all the damn time.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 12-12-2010(2): The <em>rain</em> just doesn&#039;t know what to do with its <em>spare time</em>. In the end, it just hangs around... as<strong> haze</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BladeWalker">BladeWalker</a>] 25-7-2012(): My <em>spare time</em> was a<strong> haze</strong>. My lack of focus was so great in fact, that the<strong> haze</strong> developed into a <em>weather</em> pattern that covered most of southern Kyushu.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/maxthornbow">maxthornbow</a>] 1-6-2012(): Sigh.. This is my only <em>spare time</em> off school for a while. Of all days for the <em>weather</em> to become <strong>hazy</strong>, why now?!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Max.89">Max.89</a>] 18-1-2012(): In my spare time I decided to adventure in the famous<strong> haze</strong> maze that everyone fears, but to make the situation worse it started to rain.
