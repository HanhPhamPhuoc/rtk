heisig: The character depicts a <i>clam</i> alongside a great and flashing <i>saber</i>. Think of digging for <i>clams</i> in an area where there are gaming <b>rules</b> governing how large a find has to be before you can keep it. So you take your trusty <i>saber</i>, which you have carefully notched like a yardstick, crack open a <i>clam</i> and then measure the poor little beastie to see if it is as long as the <b>rules</b> say it has to be.
