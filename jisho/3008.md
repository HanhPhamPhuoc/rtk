## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/megaboyx">megaboyx</a>] 12-1-2010(4): <em>Mr T</em> when he was a spy for the <strong>Puppet Kai</strong> government, thought that they leaders were all <em>ogres</em> and the worst kind of evil.. (He then even said he&#039;d rather work as slave labor out in THREE rice paddy fields at once than be a puppet) <strong>puppet Kai (KAIrai kugutsu ookii) large = KAIzen</strong> 傀儡 【かいらい; くぐつ】 puppet; dummy.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 13-3-2011(1): 傀儡政権 , <a href="../20608">Unicode-0x5080</a> (#20608 傀) <strong>Puppet</strong> (RTK＃2019.5) カイ, くぐつ(alt. reading of both 傀儡 and 傀儡子 , also used for 傀儡女 (くぐつめ). 傀儡師 is かいらいし) ... Parts: 亻, 鬼 <a href="../2019">ghost</a> (#2019 鬼), 亻, 3 田 ... Note: 傀 and 儡 both seem to only come in the 熟語 of 傀儡, though both in used Manga characters&#039; names. ... Story (for both Kanji): The <em>Devil Oni</em> Made 3 <em>Mr. T&#039;s</em> do it, by controlling <em>3 Mr.Ts</em> through his <em>Three Brains</em>. As anyone knows the Devil is the real <strong>Puppet</strong>master.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 8-1-2011(): <strong>puppet</strong>: I never suspected <em>Mr. T</em> was the mere <strong>puppet</strong> of a <em>demon</em>, but I should have. He wasn&#039;t very nice after all, always calling people &quot;Foo&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 8-12-2009(): <strong>puppet</strong>: Mr. T is actually a puppet controlled by a guest. His true personality is a tea drinking, church-going accountant.
