## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 1-3-2007(322): Got a <em>receipt</em> for that <em>dagger</em>, son? If not, we&#039;re going to <strong>detain</strong> you and send you to work in the <em>rice fields</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-11-2007(89): The use of RANSOM NOTE (think of a receipt with a dagger through it on a door) works great with<strong> DETAIN</strong>. Here the RANSOM NOTE says that the girl has been<strong> DETAIN</strong>ED in an undisclosed location. To get her back take the RANSOM to a empty FIELD.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 3-8-2006(41): &quot;We&#039;re<strong> detain</strong>ing you because we found a receipt on you for this dagger we found in the brain of the man your wife was having an affair with. Care to explain?&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 28-12-2008(15): The 留学生 【りゅうがくせい】went over to Japan on an international exchange program, but on his way from the airport he was <strong>detained</strong> by slave traders! They took his student-visa <em>receipts</em> and kept him under <em>knife point</em> working in the <em>rice fields</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beneus">Beneus</a>] 15-7-2009(9): We finally have enough evidence to<strong> detain</strong> the susppect. The <em>knife</em> used in the murder was found in his <em>rice field&#039; out back, and the </em>receipt* for it was in his desk drawer.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 1-12-2006(7): The 留学生 （りゅうがくせい）was<strong> detain</strong>ed for not having <em>receipts</em> for the <em>daggers</em> and <em>brains</em> she was trying to bring back into the country.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 13-5-2008(6): For this one, piggybacking off of the sign of the hare / easter bunny mnemonic that people have used for the last frames, I&#039;ll use the <em>Bad Easter Bunny</em> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnXR5Baq0X8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnXR5Baq0X8</a>), who hides a <em>blade</em> under his right ear. Here, we have the <em>Bad Easter Bunny</em> being <strong>detain</strong>ed at the airport for bringing his blade into Japan. He&#039;s on a student/ryuugakusei visa, but they won&#039;t budge, and send him out to a <em>field</em> to be shot.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 19-8-2008(5): [The police are searching your home as part of a murder investigation.] &quot;What&#039;s this? A <em>receipt</em> for the <em>dagger</em> we found in the murder victim&#039;s <em>brain</em>? I&#039;m afraid we&#039;re going to have to<strong> detain</strong> you.&quot; [Thanks scottamus].

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 20-4-2010(3): For having no <em>receipt</em> I was<strong> detain</strong>ed, so I stuck a <em>dagger</em> in the security guard&#039;s <em>brain</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 15-1-2010(3): PRIMITIVE (from RSH): <em>Receipt</em> + <em>stamp</em> = <strong>letter opener</strong> -- but the stamp becomes a <em>dagger</em> whenever the letter opener is on top. KEYWORD: I use <strong>stay</strong> (as in Chinese) instead of <strong>detain</strong> to avoid confusion with <a href="../v4/654">arrest</a> (#654 拘). STORY: To improve your knowledge in your <em>field</em>, you want to <strong>stay</strong> at a university abroad ( 留学 ). When you get the acceptance letter, you use a fine <em>letter opener</em> to mark the occasion.
