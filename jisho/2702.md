## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(82): At <em>Thanksgiving</em>, it’s <em>uncommon</em> for people to<strong> accept humbly</strong> the food: most people just dig in. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-8-2008(31): You&#039;re invited to a <em>Thanksgiving</em> party in Japan! Awesome! You&#039;re so happy that your Japanese friends are trying to make you feel at home (you&#039;ve been homesick recently). You sit down to the table, and they bring out some..uh...<em>uncommon</em> food. Really <em>uncommon</em>. Like just imagine the most <em>uncommon</em> <em>Thanksgiving</em> food ever, and that&#039;s what you&#039;re given (i don&#039;t know, a frisbee or something?). Of course, you have to be Japanese and<strong> accept humbly</strong> their food. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 9-9-2009(11): As THANKSGIVING is an American holiday, it is UNCOMMON to say いただきます! before eating. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 30-4-2010(9): &quot;<strong>ACCEPT HUMBLY</strong>&quot; is a translation for   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/頂戴する">頂戴する</a>   (chōdai-suru), a Japanese expression of <em>THANKS-GIVING</em> that shows an <em>UNCOMMON</em> degree of respect and formality, and is reserved for the most <em>UNCOMMONl</em>y solemn occasions. Ironically,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/戴">戴</a>   also appears in   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/戴きます">戴きます</a>   (いただきます), which is also a form of <em>THANKS-GIVING</em>, but is <em>anything but UNCOMMON</em>. In fact, it is so commonplace to that it borders on formulaic and meaningless. (NB: いただきます is also written   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/頂きます">頂きます</a>  ). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 11-8-2011(2): During <em>Thanksgiving</em> it is <em>uncommon</em> to see Americans<strong> accept humbly</strong> their meal. Usually they&#039;re more like &quot;Turkeyyy!!! Give me my turkeeeey, bitch!&quot;. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 2-4-2012(1): So both this and <a href="../94">place on the head</a> <span class="index">(#94 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/頂">頂</a>)</span> can be used for itadakimasu? Written either as   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/頂きます">頂きます</a>   or as   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/戴きます">戴きます</a>  . And both are correct and normal? Japanese are weird. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sulris">sulris</a>] 18-4-2011(1): At thanksgiving it is uncommon to accept your food humbly. instead you stuff yourself like a glutton. what about the starving children that live wherever starving children live nowadays? 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 16-4-2013(): There are some   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/異">異</a>   <a href="../1797">uncommon</a> <span class="index">(#1797 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/異">異</a>)</span> animals in the ark, so that Noah had to make a RICE FIELD on top of the ARK (remember position) to feed him. The other animals didn&#039;t like it, but on THANKSGIVING day, they   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/戴">戴</a>   <a href="../2702">accept humbly</a> <span class="index">(#2702 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/戴">戴</a>)</span>&quot;ACCEPT HUMBLY&quot; is a translation for   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/頂戴する">頂戴する</a>   (chōdai-suru), accept sth with gratitude that shows a degree of respect and formality, Ironically,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/戴">戴</a>   also appears in   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/戴きます">戴きます</a>   (いただきます), which is also a form of THANKS-GIVING (NB: いただきます is also written   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/頂きます">頂きます</a>  ). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kawota">kawota</a>] 21-2-2013(): The grand general gives you a <em>holy spear</em>, and you see by its very look and writings on it, that the spear is an <em>uncommon</em> one even among the <em>holy spears</em> - dating back to the days of the Noah&#039;s Ark. Of course, you <strong>accept</strong> it <strong>humbly</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/einahpets">einahpets</a>] 29-2-2012(): &quot;  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/戴きます">戴きます</a>  (いただきます)&quot; said the pilgrims that first <em>Thanksgiving</em> as they <strong>accepted humbly</strong> the <em>uncommon</em> food provided by the Indians. Also in   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/頂戴">頂戴</a>  　ちょうだい.
