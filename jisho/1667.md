heisig: "In order to keep this character distinct from that for an <i>imperial edict</i> (Frame 366), we must draw again on a pun. Think of the <b>order</b> here as a mail <b>order</b> or an <b>order</b> of pizza phoned in by the Emperor for delivery to the <b>imperial</b> palace. Then it will not be hard to put together <i>bundle</i> and <i>muscle</i> to form a story about an <b>imperial order</b>."
