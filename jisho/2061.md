## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-1-2007(165): This character refers to feudal<strong> clan</strong>s that were abolished in 1871 (Meiji 4) in favor of prefectures ( 廃藩置県 ), and thus were predecessors of the modern prefectures. As we know from 落 , flowers and water drops each have their own way of falling. This character says that<strong> clan</strong>s&#039; location was decided in the way flowers, water drops and dice fall: at random. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 5-4-2006(19): This is what members of Ku Klux<strong> Clan</strong> is doing when not meeting: pretending to live normal life by watering flowers during the day and playing dice-games with their families at night. What a double-life.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 31-8-2008(15): [A story for people using the flower+water = seaweed primitive; see <a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079</a>] It&#039;s commonly known that Japan&#039;s old feudal <strong>clan</strong>s were rated by how much rice they produced. It&#039;s less well known that they were also rated for <em>seaweed</em> (the other component of sushi). Each year the shogun would roll <em>dice</em> to determine which<strong> clan</strong> had the honour of providing him with nori that year.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 28-6-2009(3): I join a<strong> clan</strong> in World of Warcraft. Since I&#039;m the newest member, I have to water the flower garden. All the higher ranked players get to gamble with dice. It isn&#039;t fair.
