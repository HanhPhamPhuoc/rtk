1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 5-3-2006(154): <strong>FROST</strong> is kind of an <em>inter</em>-<em>weather</em>, phenomenon, something between rain, snow and freezing temp’s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 5-9-2008(75): The freezing RAIN formed<strong> FROST</strong> on the TREE right before your EYES. If you want,<strong> frost</strong>-y then think<strong> Frost</strong> Tree to get to the mnemonic. SECOND STORY:<strong> FROST</strong>Y the snowman? It&#039;s RAIN that<strong> FROST</strong>S that can then INTER-act with the kids, till he melts of course.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wholefnfro">wholefnfro</a>] 16-4-2008(58): <strong>rain</strong> changes <strong>&quot;inter&quot;</strong><strong> frost</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tgray88">tgray88</a>] 4-10-2008(57): The <em>inter</em>-action between <em>rain</em> and cold makes<strong> frost</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 26-7-2008(21): It was <em>raining</em> outside onto the trees, and you dared your friend to stick his tongue out on the tree (you weren&#039;t quite sure if it would stick, like your tongue will to metal when it gets cold). Your friend decided to one-up you and stick his <em>eye</em> on the <em>tree</em>, and just then, it got super cold and a layer of<strong> frost</strong> covered the city. Your friend&#039;s <em>eye</em> got stuck on the <em>tree</em>, but he had to go home to do his homework, so he dashed off with his <em>eye</em> stuck there on the tree.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 7-1-2010(14): When the <em>rain</em> fell down on<strong> Frost</strong>y the Snowman, all that was left was his <em>tree</em>-branch arms and coal <em>eyes</em>... 霜 [しも].

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TadghD">TadghD</a>] 16-7-2009(8): Rain comes down from above, interacts with the cold and settles as<strong> frost</strong>.
