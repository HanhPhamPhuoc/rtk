heisig: Although the writing order is different, one can remember the appearance of this character by seeing it as a <i>little needle</i> - the kind used for splitting hairs in <b>half</b>. (Again, according to rule, <i>little</i> takes a stroke beneath it in order to be placed over an element that has no horizontal line at the top.)
