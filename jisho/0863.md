## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Austin">Austin</a>] 28-10-2005(281): Compared to pants, a<strong> SKIRT</strong> is the GARMENT to be wearing when you want to use one of those Japanese toilets. It makes it so much easier: you just walk in the OUTHOUSE hike it up, and do your business.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 29-6-2008(60): Haven&#039;t you ever noticed that the men / women signs on the front of <em>outhouses</em> are sometimes very similar? The silhouettes are usually the same, but one will decidedly be wearing a <em>garment</em> in the shape of a<strong> SKIRT</strong>. Also, we&#039;ve already learned the kanji for &quot;woman&quot;, so if the signs are only in kanji you have no right to wander in and claim ignorance, perv!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag">hunchbag</a>] 5-11-2009(40): A<strong> skirt</strong> is the most convenient <em>outhouse garment</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kansaigaijin">kansaigaijin</a>] 13-2-2009(12): Women go to the <em>outhouse</em> by lifting up their <strong>skirt</strong> and under <em>garment</em>s, then laying down a nasty fart laced squirt shit.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 11-5-2007(11): In an <em>outhouse, garments</em> can get ruined easily so you might want to hike up your<strong> SKIRT</strong> Nancy.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 15-2-2007(10): I have frequented many medieval and rennaisance faires where the women dress in very full old-fashioned<strong> skirt</strong>s. These <em>garments</em> made it very difficult for them to use the little portable <em>outhouses</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/unicornpuddlefoot">unicornpuddlefoot</a>] 29-11-2008(6): I&#039;ll wear that<strong> skirt</strong> and no knickers (under garments) I meet you in the out house in five minutes.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-1-2006(6): An outhouse is dressed with a<strong> skirt</strong> (say, to indicate it&#039;s the ladies toilets). The key word refers to an ancient type of costume, not the modern<strong> skirt</strong> (but don&#039;t worry about it for the image).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 22-5-2009(5): These days many women wear jeans on a regular basis and only wear a<strong> skirt</strong> to dress up, making it their <em>esteemed garment</em> or <em>garment</em> of <em>esteem</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andfrapp">andfrapp</a>] 5-3-2011(3): The<strong> skirt</strong> is without a doubt the most practical <em>garment</em> you could wear when going to an <em>outhouse</em>.
