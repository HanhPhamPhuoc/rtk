Ever wonder how the <b>state</b>-line is drawn between <b>states</b> separated by a river? If there were little <i>drops of</i> land as in the kanji, there'd be nothing to it."

## Heisig story:

Here we see <i>drops of</i> land (little islets) rising up out of a <i>stream</i>, creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater. Ever wonder how the <b>state</b>-line is drawn between <b>states</b> separated by a river? If there were little <i>drops of</i> land as in the kanji, there'd be nothing to it.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 3-9-2007(202): There were 3 little islands in the <em>stream</em> who all decided to set themselves up as independent <strong>states</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 29-3-2008(28): シュウ　The original meaning of this character was &quot;sandbar&quot;, and for me this conjures up images of the Mississippi River, which is very wide with many sandbars and which was used to define the borders in ten American<strong> state</strong>s. Picture Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer floating by<strong> state</strong> after<strong> state</strong> as they adventure down the mighty Mississippi, occasionally beaching their raft on sandbars.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown">alatown</a>] 21-2-2009(15): All powerful<strong> STATE</strong>S grew from a few small settlements along RIVER.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/panikbuton">panikbuton</a>] 20-1-2008(12): Three votes in a<strong> state</strong> election are as meaningless as as many drops in a stream.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cyberclops">cyberclops</a>] 17-1-2010(7): The<strong> state</strong> of a <em>stream</em> is not changed by adding three <em>drops</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calderra">calderra</a>] 15-9-2009(7): A popular Japanese myth, adapted: In ancient times, a god plunged a sword into a stream. The DROPS that fell back into the STREAM formed the<strong> STATE</strong> of Japan.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kamesan">kamesan</a>] 12-9-2008(6): 3 Inseln 3 Flüsse ein Staat.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 28-8-2007(5): The 3<strong> state</strong>s were seperated by <em>streams</em> when the rain <em>drops</em> poured down.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS">TerryS</a>] 27-5-2009(3): <em>Drops</em> of land in the <em>stream</em> make it easier to locate the<strong> STATE</strong> line markers. (The day before I learned this kanji, there was an aritcle about a<strong> STATE</strong> law requiring each town to have someone walk the entire boundary every 5 years. 1 town couldn&#039;t find one, because the line goes through a lake, and the marker fell over. There are no islands or sand bars in that lake! They have to go in spring when it&#039;s warm to find it and finish this.).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 12-8-2011(2): On the left side of each <em>stream</em> an island-<strong>state</strong> was formed!
