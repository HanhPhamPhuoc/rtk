## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 4-7-2008(30): <em>Spiderman</em> is put in a <em>jail cell</em> by the fashion police for wearing<strong> scarlet</strong>. (His fellow inmates include<strong> Scarlet</strong> O&#039;Hara,<strong> Scarlet</strong>t Johansson, Captain<strong> Scarlet</strong>, The<strong> Scarlet</strong> Pimpernel, etc).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtcamero">dtcamero</a>] 24-3-2011(7): Without his<strong> SCARLET</strong> threads, peter parker is UN-SPIDERMAN...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 18-7-2007(2): Frankly <strong>Scarlet</strong>, I don&#039;t give a damn. Here we see <strong>Scarlet</strong> O&#039;Hara going to visit Rhett in his <em>jail</em> cell (damn those yankees!) wearing her new (green, and velvet incidentally) <em>threads</em>, created from Tara&#039;s (the manor) drapes.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 15-7-2010(1): The<strong> SCARLET</strong> <em>THREAD</em> woven right into her clothes in the shape of a letter &quot;A&quot; isolates her as effectively as any <em>JAIL CELL</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 8-1-2010(1): <em>Spiderman</em> is finally put in <em>jail</em> for all the damage he&#039;s caused to Forest Hills, New York. Without his<strong> scarlet</strong> suit however, he&#039;s not feeling so confident... especially with that big black guy looking at him.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tehssb">tehssb</a>] 12-12-2009(1): While in the <em>jail cell</em> Hester Prynne uses <em>thread</em> to sew the<strong> scarlet</strong> letter to her dress.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 24-1-2009(1): If you wear <strong>scarlet</strong> <em>threads</em>, the fashion police will put you in <em>jail</em>. [Thanks Katsuo].

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 17-1-2009(1): Easy if you&#039;re a Cluedo fanatic: Miss<strong> Scarlet</strong>t murdered the victim with a <em>rope</em>, so now she&#039;s in a <em>jail cell</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lisbet">lisbet</a>] 29-10-2012(): In a special issue of Spider-Man, spidey goes back in time to free the wrongfully imprisoned Hester Prynne from jail and restore the good name of the color &quot;scarlet&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 29-4-2012(): This kanji depicts what would happen if <em>Spiderman</em> were to be sent to prison and put in a <em>jail cell</em>: all the criminals he put in would beat until the floor was <strong>scarlet</strong> with his blood.
