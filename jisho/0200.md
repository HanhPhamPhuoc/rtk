heisig: You might think of the <b>frame</b> this character refers to as the sort of <b>frame</b> we have created by drawing a dark line around this kanji and its explanation. Then think of that line as made of very thin <i>wood</i>; and finally note how each time the line bends it forms a 90° angle, thus giving us the <i>nine</i> and the <i>ten</i>.
