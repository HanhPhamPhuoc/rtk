2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 30-4-2006(40): <strong>Strict</strong> masters treat even <a href="../852">intelligent</a> (#852 賢) slaves like dirt, and they get no shells.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 11-3-2008(39): I&#039;m very<strong> strict</strong> about not just sleeping with anyone. People who are <em>slaves</em> to their <em>crotches</em> often end up with <em>dirt</em>y genitalia and I don&#039;t want to get their VD. (on yomi=ケン).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 27-5-2006(33): It&#039;s a<strong> strict</strong> place...any <em>slave</em> caught violating rules will be buried up to his <em>crotch</em> in the <em>soil</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 9-1-2009(15): Look this character up on saiga-jp.com/kanji_dictionary.html? or search <em>堅</em> on jisho.org (something you should do for each kanji) and you will see its real meaning is something more like firm. 厳 (stern) has more of &quot;strict&quot; meaning keyword - firm: i have an odd fetish - my crotch only gets firm when I see slaves on dirt. However, the slaves&#039; crotches must be firm, and so must the ground. Otherwise I can&#039;t get firm.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattoc_g">mattoc_g</a>] 22-4-2009(12): SLAVES have a hard life, their masters&#039; are<strong> STRICT</strong>. They must cover their CROTCH with a loincloth and they must sleep on the DIRT so it makes them tough. This kanji has a meaning more of hard, solid and tough.
