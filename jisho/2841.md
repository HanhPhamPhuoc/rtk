heisig: "The key word in this frame refers to the underworld, the world of the dead. By way of the classic Greek association, it is also used for the &quot;dwarf planet&quot; Pluto. Since no one knows precisely when this part of the cosmos was finished, we may imagine it as the <i>crowning</i> deed of <i>day six</i> of the creation."

The key word in this frame refers to the underworld, the world of the dead. By way of the classic Greek association, it is also used for the &quot;dwarf planet&quot; Pluto. Since no one knows precisely when this part of the cosmos was finished, we may imagine it as the <i>crowning</i> deed of <i>day six</i> of the creation.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 7-6-2008(27): Here we have two people sitting on chairs, trying to set up their camera on a<strong> tripod</strong> and periodically checking the viewfinder with their <em>eyes</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 13-5-2010(4): (NB: I use <strong>THREE-LEGGED KETTLE</strong> for 鼎 , and reserve <strong>TRIPOD</strong> for 鬲 <a href="../39730">Unicode-0x9b32</a> (#39730 鬲).) This <strong>THREE-LEGGED KETTLE</strong> is used for sacrificial incense-burning. 鼎 shows a watchful <em>EYE</em> carefully putting the offering material in the opening of the <strong>KETTLE</strong>, which is shown as being squarely supported <em>ON EACH SIDE</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 2-12-2008(3): <em>Eye</em> (I) really wanted a<strong> tripod</strong>, so I went into a camera store with <em>two pistols</em> and got everyone to <em>put their hands in the air</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 9-3-2010(2): For anyone who&#039;s read the series, to me this is a pictograph of one of John Christopher&#039;s<strong> Tripod</strong>s, with one large evil glowing <em>eye</em> and a mechanical skeleton around it. <a href="http://bit.ly/thetripods">http://bit.ly/thetripods</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(1): Your <em>eye</em> looks through the viewfinder as a three-legged<strong> tripod</strong> supports your camera.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 31-12-2008(1): This is a pictograph of a three-legged kettle, for cooking eyes!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-7-2007(1): Two <em>one-sided&#039;s</em> hold up your <em>eye</em>...a true<strong> tripod</strong> indeed!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Miyumera">Miyumera</a>] 3-8-2012(): Pictograph. The camera has the EYE and it needs to rest on a<strong> tripod</strong> made up of two chairs facing each other and a &#039;T&#039; for &#039;tripod&#039; stamped on each.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 3-4-2012(): <strong>Tripod</strong> holds the eye of Sauron&#039;s camera to keep it stable.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 24-4-2011(): A pictograph of two people sitting on two little stools and having a staring contest. Eventually, one guy tries to cheat by taking his <em>eye</em> out and just putting it on a<strong> tripod</strong>.
