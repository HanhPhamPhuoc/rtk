heisig: "The key word in this frame refers to the underworld, the world of the dead. By way of the classic Greek association, it is also used for the "dwarf planet" Pluto. Since no one knows precisely when this part of the cosmos was finished, we may imagine it as the <i>crowning</i> deed of <i>day six</i> of the creation."
