## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-2-2007(60): Your <em>elbow</em> is <em>bound up</em> so that your biceps will stay<strong> flexed</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 18-1-2011(18): In RTK1 Supplement as &quot;hooked.&quot; A friend <strong>hooked</strong> someone literally, by <em>binding them up</em> with their <strong>hooked</strong> <em>elbow</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 2-12-2007(14): My <em>elbow</em> was <em>bound up</em> in a cast, making it impossible to keep it<strong> flexed</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drwaltoa">drwaltoa</a>] 11-9-2011(6): Peter Pan tried to escape, but Hook hooked him by the <em>elbow</em> and <em>bound</em> him <em>up</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-1-2009(3): At the risk of confusing with &quot;captured&quot; (frame 1018) I&#039;m going to use &quot;to capture&quot; as the keyword since this kanji often shows up in kidnapping related compounds and<strong> flexed</strong> is hard for me to work with. Here, you bind up the kidnapping victim&#039;s arms together at the elbows behind his back when you capture him. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bej001">bej001</a>] 8-12-2012(2): Bend your arm at the ELBOW and BIND it up. There, now it looks <strong>hooked</strong> and can be used as a hook. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lernsky">lernsky</a>] 18-2-2012(2): Your <em>elbow</em> only fits into a <em>ladle</em>, if it is <strong>flexed</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adamrandell1296">adamrandell1296</a>] 25-11-2012(1): Sir Hammerlock hooked old slappy the thresher, but when he tried to bind him up, slappy bit off his arm to the elbow and escaped.
