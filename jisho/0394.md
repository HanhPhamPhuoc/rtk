## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 24-9-2007(245): Features like <em>stones</em> and <em>groves of trees</em> are the<strong> cornerstone</strong>s of a happy <em>zoo</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 9-11-2007(60): A zoo which is still under construction is already full of animals. At the moment, only the<strong> cornerstone</strong> has been set in place. To temporarily keep the animals from escaping, a closely-packed grove of small trees is planted around the stone. (Note that this zoo needs some serious <em>mending</em>.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 4-7-2008(39): <em>Stone Grove Zoo</em> is the new<strong> cornerstone</strong> in animal exhibits! If you love animals you need to check out <em>Stone Grove Zoo!</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jshield1">jshield1</a>] 23-4-2009(29): How am I the only one who doesn&#039;t see how mend turned into zoo with one stroke.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 17-12-2007(15): To make room for the new <em>zoo</em>, they use dynamite sending all the <em>grove&#039;s</em> trees flying in the air. That big <em>stone</em> on the left now serves as<strong> cornerstone</strong>. (Variation on ziggr&#039;s story, with more emphasis on placement that was giving me trouble).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 3-12-2008(11): A<strong> cornerstone</strong> is often laid to commemorate the erection of a new building or facility. The manager of this <em>zoo</em> got so carried away and ordered a <em>stone</em> of such gargantuan proportions that there was no more room to plant a <em>grove</em> to provide the animals with shade. Ever the quick thinker, this manager decided to plant his <em>grove</em> atop his <em>zoo animals</em>, all of whom thus were to pass their time by the enormous <em>stone</em><strong> cornerstone</strong> with a <em>grove</em> of trees upon their backs.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spoonz">Spoonz</a>] 17-2-2009(7): <strong>Cornerstone</strong>: something that is essential, indispensable, or basic It is a<strong> cornerstone</strong> to place <em>stones</em> and <em>trees</em> in a <em>zoo</em> to imitate the habitat of most of the animals!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 4-3-2008(7): The <em>grove of trees</em> ripped the<strong> CORNERSTONE</strong> of the <em>zoo</em> away, thereby creating an exit for the animals. (Imagine the walking trees from Lord of the Rings).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 7-2-2008(7): An ancient <em>zoo</em> under a great <em>forest</em> is marked around the edges by huge <strong>cornerSTONEs</strong>. Imagine the great zoo of the people of Angkor Wat in the jungles of Cambodia.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 20-2-2010(4): The main attraction and <strong>corner<em>stone</em></strong> of this <em>zoo</em> is the <em>grove</em> of Tolkien Ent Trees. They are more important than the zoo itself - hence they are on top.
