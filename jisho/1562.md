## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 6-3-2010(218): &quot;Walking legs&quot; over &quot;bushes&quot; needs to have a primitive meaning of its own. It appears in several kanji, such as 縫 <a href="../1563">sew</a> (#1563 縫), 逢 <a href="../2417">tryst</a> (#2417 逢), 蜂 <a href="../2687">bee</a> (#2687 蜂), and 鋒 <a href="../2768">sword's point</a> (#2768 鋒), and it is clumsy to work bushes and walking legs into every story. &quot;Pointy&quot; works fairly well: the walking legs are stuck on top of the pointy part of the bush; and for this character: a <strong>summit</strong> is the <em>pointy</em> end of a <em>mountain</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 17-4-2008(72): Moses climbs to the<strong> summit</strong> of the mountain using his walking legs to talk to the burning bush.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 17-5-2009(57): If you are using the &quot;walking legs + bushes = pubic hair&quot; primitive... The nudist colony was banished to the top of the mountain&#039;s<strong> summit</strong>, so that nobody would have to see their bushes again!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 3-1-2007(27): Like in the next frame, the right side element is &quot;walking through bushes&quot;. This time they&#039;re not on the road, but on a mountain, whose<strong> summit</strong> you&#039;re trying to reach. (the element will come in at least 逢 again).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 16-8-2009(16): <em>Bush</em> between <em>walking legs</em> = <em>pubic hair</em>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 11-9-2008(13): (I&#039;m using <em>SPIKY BUSHES</em> as a privative to be more distinctive in my mind) STORY: On the track to the <em>mountain&#039;s</em><strong> summit</strong> my <em>walking legs</em> got all scratched up by <em>spiky bushes</em> along the way.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 6-7-2007(8): Alice uses her <em>walking legs</em> to get to the<strong> summit</strong> of the <em>mountain</em>. The<strong> summit</strong> is shaped like a vibrator and she puts her <em>bush</em> on it. // Primitive: When <em>Alice</em> grows up, she&#039;ll grow a <em>bush</em> down there (hence extending the stroke down). <em>bushes</em> = <em>Alice&#039;s bush</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 14-3-2007(8): Upon reaching the<strong> summit</strong> of the <em>mountain</em>, I noticed my <em>walking legs</em> were all gouged up from walking through prickly <em>bushes</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 24-12-2007(6): &quot;Who&#039;s idea was it to <strong>summit</strong> a <em>mountain</em> for our class trip?!&quot; complains the prissy cheerleader grudgingly <em>walking through the bushes</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 11-10-2010(4): 峰 <a href="../1562">summit</a> (#1562 峰) ホウ(夆), みね(also 峯 , 嶺 ) ... Parts: 山 , 夆 ...

Trying to hurdle 丰<em>Bushes</em>; they jammed between your 夂<em>walking legs</em> because you got a <strong>Stinger</strong> ... Story: <strong>Summit</strong> Story: When you reach the <strong>summit</strong> of <em>Mount Everest</em>, breathing feels like <em>Stingers</em> in your chest. ... cf: 蜂 <a href="../2687">bee</a> (#2687 蜂), 縫う <a href="../1563">sew</a> (#1563 縫), 逢う <a href="../2417">tryst</a> (#2417 逢), 峯 <a href="../2977">summit [alternate]</a> (#2977 峯), 鋒 <a href="../2768">sword's point</a> (#2768 鋒), 蓬 <a href="../2375">wormwood</a> (#2375 蓬).
