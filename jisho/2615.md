## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 17-3-2008(26): If I have any <em>bamboo</em> shoots left over from my stirfry I wrap them up in <em>foil</em> to keep them moist <em>overnight</em>. Then I can use them the next day.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(8): I always roll up my<strong> foil</strong> and hide it in sticks of <em>bamboo overnight</em>. This is to<strong> foil</strong> any attempt to steal it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 6-7-2008(4): Imagine staying in a <em>bamboo</em> forest <em>overnight</em> with only one of those thin,<strong> foil</strong> survival blankets to keep warm. <a href="http://www.lasoutdoors.com/images/CS02-Reflective-Survival-bl.JPG">http://www.lasoutdoors.com/images/CS02-Reflective-Survival-bl.JPG</a>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-8-2008(2): Mirrors are way played out - I keep it grimy with mine, and do my <em>cocaine</em> off of some<strong> foil</strong>. It&#039;s easier to carry with me when I go to stay <em>overnight</em> at a friend&#039;s (just ball it up in your pocket!), and it&#039;s not suspicious at all. I mean, come on. Imagine getting caught with <em>coke</em>, a mirror, and a razor - too obvious. But if you use<strong> foil</strong>, and divide your lines with a bit of <em>bamboo</em> and get caught with all that, you might get off with the &quot;my friend asked me to hold this for him&quot; excuse.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/juandixonformvp">juandixonformvp</a>] 23-9-2012(1): People wrapped food in bamboo leaves to keep it overnight, now we just use<strong> foil</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 22-2-2010(1): If you&#039;re staying <em>overnight</em> somewhere, make sure to bring a little<strong> foil</strong> of <em>weed</em> to keep things interesting.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(1): <em>Bamboo</em> left out <em>overnight</em> needs to be put in<strong> foil</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 8-12-2011(): When I stayed at an <em>overnight</em> hotel in Japan, I found that they layed out some pieces of <em>bamboo</em> wrapped up in <strong>foil</strong> and gold <strong>leaf</strong> in my room.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sabretou">sabretou</a>] 11-10-2011(): As a travelling warrior, I often have to sleep <em>overnight</em> in faraway taverns. That&#039;s usually a good time and place to ambush me, so I always bar the door with my <em>bamboo</em> stick to<strong> foil</strong> their plans.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 22-2-2011(): To keep the <em>bamboo</em> safe <em>overnight</em> (and to<strong> foil</strong> the fox&#039;s plans) wrap it in<strong> foil</strong>.
