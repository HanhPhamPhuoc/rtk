heisig: "The painting of a <i>deer</i> itself with its form and color is enough to fill the bill for an image of something <b>lovely</b>. But to give a bit of contrast, we see two <i>mediocre</i> drawings from a later age on two patches of <i>ceiling</i> above. Note that the drop in <i>mediocre</i> has been lengthened somewhat and the second stroke drawn down straight."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-4-2007(153): The anthropologist made an exact <em>deer painting</em> from the cave <em>ceiling</em> on the <em>ceiling</em> of his house. Too bad they&#039;re both <em>mediocre</em>. All his wife could say was, &quot;How...<strong>lovely</strong>.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 16-2-2008(107): <strong>Lovely</strong> bambi.... pictographe : just take a look at those innocent open eyes (part 1 it&#039;s not more far fetched than seeing mediocre in it) with thin eyebrows what a<strong> lovely</strong> deer ...(part 2).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 6-12-2007(52): The <em>deer painting</em> is so<strong> lovely</strong>, when compared to the two <em>mediocre</em> paintings on two sections of <em>ceiling</em> above.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 6-10-2008(17): A <em>crocodile with raised eyebrows</em> eyes a<strong> lovely</strong> <em>deer</em> it might have for dinner.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 28-5-2009(12): A creepy deerophile peers with his <em>beedy eyes</em> over the top of a <em>deers</em> back, and whispers<strong> lovely</strong> to himself.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 1-8-2009(6): I thought deer were<strong> lovely</strong> creatures- that is, until my <em>eyes</em> met this kanji.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 18-12-2009(5): The two <em>mediocre</em> are eyes with eyebrows watching the<strong> lovely</strong> <em>deer</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 25-6-2008(4): (レイ) One day two deers -1 male &amp; 1 female- have a chance encounter. It&#039;s a<strong> lovely</strong> moment - love at 1st site. Each knew instantly that they would become two &amp; that this encounter was special -each thinking the chances of meeting were as slim as finding the same drop in the wind. Plus, instead of writing 二 as 1 on top of the other, each knew they were equals so they wrote the 2 lines that make up the 二 on the same horizontal plane.<strong> Lovely</strong> moments like this happen only once in a lifetime.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 6-11-2007(4): One deer met another deer. They were both very ordinary. What made it<strong> lovely</strong> is that they fell in love. (Thanks takoman.).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HydroKirby">HydroKirby</a>] 11-4-2012(2): Oh lucky. I have a Chinese classmate named 丽阳 (Li yang). 丽 means beautiful, magnificent, or elegant; it is actually the simplified version of this character, 麗 . Story: Even if <em>Li</em> yang was a <em>deer</em>, she would still look <strong>lovely</strong>.
