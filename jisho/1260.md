## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-12-2005(146): Also as part of some army survival exercise, the <em>cadets</em> (including <em>Bender</em> see frame 1172) are sent into the <em>woods</em> to build a<strong> vat</strong> (for collecting water for example).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 27-11-2007(63): <em>Bender the Cadet</em> (kudos to Fuaburisu) is found on an army training exercise, hiding behind a <em>tree</em>, getting drunk on the famous scotch whiskey<strong> Vat</strong> 69.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 23-3-2008(58): A true (?) story about Captain Cook and sauerkraut. Cook was convinced that sauerkraut would prevent the disease scurvy among his sailors, but his problem was getting his sailors to eat the stuff. He tricked the low-ranking <em>cadets</em> into eating sauerkraut by storing it in <em>wood</em><strong> vat</strong>s labeled &quot;for officers&#039; use only&quot;. The <em>cadets</em> thus believed that they were being unfairly denied access to the officers-only<strong> vat</strong>s, so they secretly stole and ate the sauerkraut - which was exactly what Cook wanted them to do.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 7-7-2009(29): Space <em>cadets</em> are decompressed in <em>wooden</em><strong> vat</strong>s when they return to Earth.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 21-11-2006(22): Cadets have to bathe in wooden<strong> vat</strong>s.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 15-3-2011(5): The main reason behind <em>Cadet</em> Bender&#039;s expulsion from the Academy was that he drank an entire<strong> vat</strong> of the Commandant&#039;s personal store of fine <em>wood</em>ed chardonnay. When confronted with his crime, Cadet Bender said, &quot;Bite my shiny metal ass!&quot; 槽 うけ (arch) basin, tub; 槽 ふね tank, tub,<strong> vat</strong>, trough.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meiko452">meiko452</a>] 11-11-2010(5): Behind the WOODEN<strong> vat</strong> of beer was the drunken CADET.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxg">tritonxg</a>] 16-4-2010(5): [FR]cuve japlt:N1<strong> SÔ</strong> kanji&amp;kana:1644 <em>arbre+cadet</em> <strong>cuvée spéciale du Mouton Cadet :</strong> le vieillissement en <strong>CUVE</strong>S en BOIS donne un goùt caractéristique au Mouton-CADET 水槽 【すいそう】water tank;cistern;fish tank 湯槽 【ゆぶね】bathtub 油槽 【ゆそう】oil tank 浴槽 【よくそう】bathtub.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 12-9-2007(5): [+fua,pepe,akro] And here we have the reason why <em>Bender the Cadet</em> accidentally blew up more than just that <em>one</em> <em>sun</em>. He&#039;s stolen the massive <em>wooden</em> German wine<strong> vat</strong>, hidden it on his ship, and drank the entire thing in one gulp. Then he ate it because he said that <em>wood</em> absorbs wine well and there was still more in there.
