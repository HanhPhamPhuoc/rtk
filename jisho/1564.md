## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 14-3-2007(209): I put my <em>fingers</em> together in<strong> worship</strong> of the <em>bush</em> that hangs from the <em>ceiling</em> -- that wonderful mistletoe which has gotten me kissed by many a girl. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 3-7-2008(153): Because I<strong> worship</strong> her, I only finger ONE BUSH, her&#039;s, and no others! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 20-1-2008(72): Imagine a weird cult where you hang a <em>bush from the ceiling</em> and then point at it with one <em>finger</em> saying &quot;<em>Bush</em>, <em>bush</em>, <em>bush</em>, I<strong> worship</strong> the bush!&quot;. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSleeve">TheSleeve</a>] 5-11-2007(31): PRESIDENT BUSH thought that coming to power would cause people to<strong> WORSHIP</strong> him, but now that his approval rating is so low, people just give him the FINGER and hang BUSH-pinatas from the CEILING to hit with bats. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 5-6-2008(28): Some people<strong> worship</strong> George <em>Bush</em>. I&#039;d like to hang him from the <em>ceiling</em> and give him the <em>finger</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 6-3-2007(13): A bush hanging from the ceiling = <em>mistletoe</em>. Mistletoe was<strong> worship</strong>ped by ancient pagans because it&#039;s evergreen and the viscous juice of its white berries resembles human semen. Of course, in kanjiland, they don&#039;t<strong> worship</strong> mistletoe, but mistle<em>finger</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 26-12-2010(11): A boy suddenly kisses the girl he <strong>worships</strong>. The girl demands an explanation, and the boy innocently points a <em>finger</em> up to the <em>ceiling</em> from which <em>bush</em>-like mistletoe is suspended. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 10-6-2009(10): (Warning: this one is kinda bad) Do not <em>finger</em> your <em>bush</em> during<strong> worship</strong>. If you&#039;re caught masturbating during the service, you&#039;ll be <em>hanged from the ceiling</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asayoru">Asayoru</a>] 2-11-2010(6): I imagine a weird cult where they suspend virgins from the <em>ceiling</em> to<strong> worship</strong> their <em>bushes</em>… with their <em>fingers</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thermal">thermal</a>] 24-6-2008(4): For Christmas, Satinists<strong> worship</strong> a <em>bush</em> (definitely not a christmas tree!) they hang from the ceiling and decorate with torn off human <em>fingers</em>.
