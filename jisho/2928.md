## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 5-12-2009(15): [+mantixen] A<strong> bodhisattva</strong> visits <em>The Pinnacle</em> to provide <em>flowers</em> and meditation <em>products</em> to the unenlightened.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(15): [+megaqwerty] This is the<strong> Bodhisattva</strong>, who wants to help release the wicked from the painful cycle of life. Of course, the most vain and wicked are the pathetic lamers in the <em>Pinnacle</em>. He goes to register to stand at the station and hand out <em>products</em>. The registrar - &quot;Okay, buddy, what are you selling?&quot; &quot;Nothing,&quot; he says. &quot;I am giving out physical <em>products</em> to entice true enlightment.&quot; &quot;Whatever, dude...&quot; He gets his license, and hands out <em>flowers</em> to anyone who will take them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 12-6-2008(4): Flower, pinnacle, product: I didn&#039;t understand the terrorist:<strong> bodhisattva</strong>... body fatwa? Hmm.. just to be sure, I gave him the booby trap <em>flower</em> (a <em>product</em> of the <em>Pinnacle</em>). Later, I learned that<strong> bodhisattva</strong> is someone who postpones his or her own enlightenment to help others. Oops...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(3): A<strong> bodhisattva</strong> from the <em>pinnacle</em> sells <em>flower</em>-scented <em>products</em> to the unenlightened.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 11-3-2010(2): The<strong> bodhisattva</strong> sat outside the entrance to <em>The Pinnacle</em>, blessing all the hand-made <em>products</em> as they come out the gate. He stamps them with the mark &quot; ピナクル産 &quot;, meaning &quot;<em>Product</em> of <em>the Pinnacle</em>&quot;, which confirms their authenticity. After stamping, the<strong> bodhisattva</strong>&#039;s assistant places a hibiscus <em>flower</em> on top of the blessed <em>product</em>, and everyone is happy. (The most popular agricultural <em>product</em> of <em>The Pinnacle</em>, incidentally, is the 薩摩芋 (さつまいも), or purple sweet potato.).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 23-3-2011(1): I&#039;m changing this to <strong>heroic-minded one</strong> which is one possible translation of the keyword. STORY: The <strong>heroic-minded</strong> one is ever watchful of evil, but in the meantime, he runs a nice <em>flower</em> and garden <em>products</em> store in <em>pinnacle</em> town.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 11-3-2011(1): 薩摩焼 , 薩摩藩 , 薩摩藷 =薩摩芋, 菩薩 , 弥勒菩薩 , 普賢菩薩 , 地蔵菩薩 , 薩隅方言 (Satsuma Ben), 薩摩揚げ , <a href="../2956">bodhisattva</a> (#2956 薩) サツ ... Parts: 艹, 阝, 産 1560 ... Story:Outside Buddhist texts, refers to Satsuma 薩摩 , trad. name for Kagoshima. (For UK people, this is why the fruit is called a Satsuma. In Japan the fruit is a ミカン( 蜜柑 ), in the US it is called Clementine, or Mandarin Orange.) The <em>Pinnacle Product</em> of <strong>Satsuma</strong> is the crowning <em>Flower</em> of the <strong>Bodhisattva</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hirata">hirata</a>] 25-2-2013(): A<strong> bodhisattva</strong> offers flowers at The Pinnacle to people too engrossed with their prodcuts to become enlightened.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 11-11-2012(): A<strong> bodhisattva</strong> is anyone who has achieved enlightenment or encourages it in others. I used to make quilted <em>products</em> with <em>flower</em> patterns on them, but when I became a<strong> bodhisattva</strong>, I took them all up to the <em>pinnacle</em> of a snowy mountain and threw them away because I no longer need earthly possessions.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtcamero">dtcamero</a>] 19-4-2011(): OBAMA showers moderate voters with FLOWERS and PRODUCTS until they elect him their<strong> BODHISATTVA</strong>.
