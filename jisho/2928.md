## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 7-11-2008(70): The <em>maestro</em> lives on top of a<strong> large hill</strong> so that he can play music at over <em>ten</em> decibels without anyone giving a damn. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 13-7-2010(19): <strong>Note to those who have not got this far in the book:</strong> This is the full kanji for the <em>Pinnacle</em> primitive (i.e. only the left-hand version of the primitive). The full kanji for the <em>City Walls</em> primitive is <a href="../2180">city walls</a> <span class="index">(#2180 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/邑">邑</a>)</span>. <em>Beyonce</em> went for an invigorating walk up a<strong> large hill</strong> on a summer&#039;s afternoon. Since the grass was so lush and cool, she took off her sandals and immediately stepped on a used hypodermic <em>needle</em>.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/岐">岐</a>  <strong>阜</strong>県　ぎ<strong>ふ</strong>けん Gi<strong>fu</strong> Prefecture. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 7-6-2009(11): <em>James Bond</em> is planning a surprise attack on the enemy. He&#039;s sitting on top of a hill, overlooking where he expects the enemy to go by. He checks the <em>hand of his watch (the needle)</em>, noting that there are <em>ten</em> seconds left before the enemy arrives. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 11-4-2011(3): Ludwig van Beethoven, the famous and famously irascible <em>maestro</em>, moves to the <strong>largest hill</strong> he can find in Vienna. At <em>10^10</em> feet above sea level (a ridiculously impossible height), he can compose his <em>tenth</em> symphony in peace. Unfortunately, death takes him before he completes it. Do not confuse with <a href="../1039">hillock</a> <span class="index">(#1039 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/塚">塚</a>)</span> or <a href="../1329">hill</a> <span class="index">(#1329 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/丘">丘</a>)</span>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/barbouraj">barbouraj</a>] 5-1-2012(1): The <em>maestro</em> actually founded the Pinnacle. He got so popular that he had to stand atop<strong> large hill</strong>s to accommodate the largest audience; they resembled <em>needles</em> below him. Once he made enough money, drawing on the vertiginous inspiration of his performance locale, he retired and established the Pinnacle. But not yet! No pinnacles here!
