## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 17-4-2007(130): <em>Captain Hook</em>, his <strong>spirit</strong> crushed, is lying on the ground cursing <em>Wolverine</em> who has defeated him with his far superior claws.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Balaam">Balaam</a>] 2-2-2008(57): You&#039;re reclining on the floor trying to hook a sheaf with a small hook through the cracks. That you&#039;ve been doing this for seven hours without success shows your burning<strong> spirit</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-7-2009(34): <em>Wolverine</em> has a fighting<strong> spirit</strong>, and even while <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> sharpens the <em>hooks</em> on his claws.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 30-5-2006(27): Hint : the first four strokes may be seen as <em>Captain Hook</em> : <em>reclining on the floor</em>, shaking his <em>hook</em> in the air and moaning &quot;Peter Pan! Why did you elude me again! Whyyy!&quot;. Se here we have Captain Hook having one of his fits, and about the only thing that will bring him his<strong> spirit</strong> back is a <em>sheaf</em>. The last part probably won&#039;t make sense but I am French speaking and somehow I settled onto the image of a &quot;bouquet&quot; of flowers for the word &quot;sheaf&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 22-5-2009(18): Someone is <em>lying</em> on the <em>floor</em>, a huge <em>x</em> ripped into their stomach with a <em>fishhook</em>. A passer by says &quot;Gen<strong>ki</strong> desu ka&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 18-6-2008(17): One of the most common Japanese phrases you&#039;ll ever say is 元 <strong>気</strong>ですか？　（げんきですか？　how are you? (also in 天気 - weather).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mary_K">Mary_K</a>] 28-8-2009(13): So long as I can remember that き=<strong> spirit</strong>, then it&#039;ll be simple.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 26-8-2007(7): Peter Pan and <em>Captain Hook</em> were fencing on the barn roof. By a deft lunge, Peter took Captain Hook off balance, which sent him crushing right through the roof and to the heaps of <em>sheaf</em> on the barn <em>floor</em>. <em>Reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> and shaking his <em>hook</em> in frustration, Captain Hook felt his <strong>spirit</strong> drop. Day was irrevocably ruined.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eckbw">eckbw</a>] 22-12-2010(6): Dying man: Reclining on the floor, I felt my life ebbing away, the grim reaper hooking my<strong> spirit</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/digicult">digicult</a>] 22-6-2009(6): While casually <em>reclining on the floor</em>, <em>Death</em> uses a <em>fishhook</em> to pick off the<strong> spirit</strong>s of passers-by, one by one. He must be bored today.
