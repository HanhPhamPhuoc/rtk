Water . . . ascend.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 8-11-2007(276): Scuba divers know that when you <em>ascend</em> in the <em>water</em>, your<strong> lucidity</strong> increases (For non-divers, the deeper you go, the more you become mentally impaired by nitrogen narcosis, every 50 feet is like drinking one martini). Scuba divers also know that as you <em>ascend</em> in the <em>water</em>, the<strong> lucidity</strong> of the <em>water</em> improves, too.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 6-7-2009(26): Lucid dreams allow me to control what is happening. In a drowning nightmare, I forced<strong> lucidity</strong> and allowed myself ascend to the surface.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(22): A few <em>drops of acid/peyote</em> and the Indians obtain <strong>lucidity</strong> on their vision quest, as if they were floating in the <strong>lucid</strong> sky.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 22-1-2006(12): The keyword refers to limpid <em>water</em>, but also to something that is clear (as in &quot;crystal clear&quot;). In Buddhism the thinking mind is often compared to a pond : if you stir the <em>water</em>, the mud from the bottom mixes with the water, and the mind is &quot;muddy&quot;. To attain<strong> lucidity</strong>, one has to let the mud settle, or as in this kanji, take a shortcut and just <em>ascend</em> through the <em>water</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 22-2-2008(9): This kanji is also used for CLEAR WEATHER. Imagine the RAIN/WATER ASCENDING back up into the sky, and the clouds floating away, giving you CLEAR WEATHER. (it&#039;s like hitting rewind).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 10-7-2009(6): As a scuba diver <em>ascends</em> through the <em>water</em>,<strong> lucidity</strong> returns to it as it brightens (thanks mspertus).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 31-12-2008(6): A lucid mind needs only water to ascend.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 28-8-2009(5): Waking up is like <em>ascending</em> through a <em>water</em>y dream-state toward surface<strong> lucidity</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 15-4-2012(4): The wiktionary definition for this character is &quot;To purify water by allowing sediment to settle.&quot; Read another way would be water ascending to the surface until it becomes clear, or, lucid.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 13-6-2008(3): I was dreaming about <em>ascending</em> into heaven until you poured <em>water</em> on my head and woke me up. Then I was lucid - and pissed off.
