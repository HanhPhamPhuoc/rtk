## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(89): Little did you know, the <em>woman</em> who made you <em>climax</em> was your<strong> niece</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 16-11-2008(14): My<strong> niece</strong> is a WOMAN now, and can make herself CLIMAX.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 11-7-2009(7): WTF?!? did some fucking Roman emperor or southern hillbilly make up this Kanji? no, just don&#039;t even picture that.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lankydan">lankydan</a>] 13-9-2007(5): <strong>Niece</strong> (woman associated keyword so the woman part is taken care of here) does a splendid job in the <em>climax</em> when she plays piano sonatas or any other piece. We can imagine a<strong> niece</strong> playing her piano recital. After traversing the <em>climax</em> of a piano piece from the Romantic period, we can see the <em>women</em> in the audience are bursting in tears. (so much that only the men applauded when the piece concluded).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 2-11-2009(4): Discussing a mystery-movie with a friend... &quot;I think this WOMAN is the key to understanding the CLIMAX of the movie. She is the<strong> NIECE</strong> of the guy who was murdereded at the beginning and as an orphan she...&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 3-8-2009(4): A little <em>girl</em> who likes to throw <em>dirt</em> on the <em>wall</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 27-1-2009(3): Your<strong> niece</strong> and I disproved the myth that <em>women</em> can&#039;t <em>climax</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 5-10-2011(1): My boss&#039; <strong>niece</strong> was the first <em>woman</em> to make me <em>climax</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 29-10-2010(): 姪 <a href="../2201">niece</a> (#2201 姪)めい ... Parts: 女 , 至 ... Story: Learn with 甥 <a href="../2910">nephew</a> (#2910 甥), because it would be pointless not to. Your big sister brings her kids (boys and girls) over. You spy on them when they take their bath. The nephews , <em>Boys</em> (even if they are <em>生 (naked)</em> are no big deal. But when the <em>Girls</em> get naked, you cannot help but <em>Climaxing</em> because AKB48, or whatever loli fetish is rolling around your head. Oy Vey it&#039;s おい めい.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 7-12-2009(): Already shamed by the pregnancy of her teenage daughter, <em>Sarah Palin</em> followed her<strong> niece</strong> around, bursting in on her whenever she was about to <em>climax</em> to make sure that there were no further children born out of wedlock to the Palin clan.
