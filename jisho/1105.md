heisig: "The &quot;<b>wherefore</b>&quot; of this kanji explains the reason or origin of a thing. It does this graphically by depicting a seed in a <i>rice field</i> sending up a single sprout, which is the whole why and <b>wherefore</b> of the seed's falling in the earth and dying. (When the <i>flower</i> appears, you will recall from frame 249, we have a full <i>seedling</i>.)"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-11-2007(155): &quot;<strong>Wherefore</strong> art thou, <em>Sprouteo</em>?&quot; (Juliet has fallen in love with a brussel sprout) (OR: A brussel sprout has fallen from Juliet&#039;s dinner plate and rolled off). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 16-1-2008(152): &quot;Cogito <strong>ergo</strong> sum.&quot;<strong> Wherefore</strong> is a bad choice here for two reasons. For one, it&#039;s often mistranslated as &quot;where&quot; when in fact it&#039;s an urge to know a cause or reason; and two, because this kanji represents the reason, not the urge. [A thought <em>sprouts</em> from my <em>brain</em>. I think, <strong>therefore</strong> I am.]. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 4-7-2007(37): Errata: Stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. The vertical stroke is #3. (story: dingomick).

(This takes on the primitive of the much more memorable <em>BRUSSEL SPROUT</em>). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 16-2-2010(18): <strong>Wherefore</strong> art thou, Romeo. He&#039;s in the <em>rice field</em>. You can see his hair sticking up above the rice. New Primitive: Romeo. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delbertmon">delbertmon</a>] 16-12-2009(11): <strong>Wherefore</strong> do we plant rice seeds in the <em>rice field</em>? For it to sprout and grow-up into rice. Pictograph of the<strong> wherefore</strong> of rice. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 11-11-2008(6): <strong>Reason</strong> (but I prefer <strong>Therefore</strong>) : The <strong>Reason</strong> we want this field is because of the <a href="../1107">oil</a> <span class="index">(#1107 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/油">油</a>)</span> <em>&#039;potentially&#039; sprouting up</em>. // <strong>Stoke order</strong> is the same as field - The 3rd stroke is the long vertical one according to <a href="http://www.yamasa.cc/members/ocjs/kanjidic.nsf/7b05bc174a2b1b5249256a540000a8b8/c095f653a9f0fbde49256a90002ec54a">http://www.yamasa.cc/members/ocjs/kanjidic.nsf/7b05bc174a2b1b5249256a540000a8b8/c095f653a9f0fbde49256a90002ec54a</a>!OpenDocument / ユ、 ユウ you2 유 (yu).
