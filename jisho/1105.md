## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 3-11-2005(188): A man earns his living<strong> by means of</strong> the plow. I imagine a sweating man dragging a bronze-age &quot;ard&quot; behind him as he plows his field himself, too poor to afford an ox.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 23-1-2008(42): Mr T now makes a living<strong> by means of</strong> a plow/hoe and the sweat he puts into it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 12-5-2009(31): <strong>By means of</strong> a <em>plow</em> and a sweat <em>drop</em> on his brow, a <em>person</em> earns his living.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Euphemism">Euphemism</a>] 12-4-2012(9): <strong>By means of</strong> the plow, with sweat on his brow, a man earns his chow.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 11-9-2011(7): 以上 , 以前 , 以外 , 以降 , 以下 , 以て =以って=もって, 以心伝心 , <a href="../v4/1028">by means of</a> (#1028 以) イ, (もって) ... Parts: レ, ソ, 丶 (cf: 似ている <a href="../v4/1029">becoming/similar</a> (#1029 似) ... Note: ’Plow’ is only used in 2 character 以 , 瓦 ... Story: If you use &quot;Person&quot; in this Story, you might end up wanting to put 亻in it; more importantly the shape will be wrong. Learn your レ ソ n : This is written almost like those two Katakana characters then the drop last. Memorize it <strong>By Means of</strong> the Katakana plus a drop.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 27-5-2009(7): Most <em>people</em> have to live<strong> by means of</strong> a <em>plow</em> and the <em>drop</em>s of sweat on their brow. Not <em>Chuck Norris</em> - he just roundhouse-kicks the field, and it grows crops instantly out of fear.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 11-9-2007(7): I propose that the primitive meaning <em>hoe</em> should replace <em>plough</em>. This is because a <em>hoe</em> is of course just a plough you can hold in your hand...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Median">Median</a>] 30-3-2013(5): Memorize: い。 Ijou( 以上 ) | Izen( 以前 ) | Igai( 以外 ) | Irai( 以来 ) | Ika( 以下 ).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 17-10-2009(5): Here&#039;s a <em>person</em> getting their exercise (see the <em>drop</em> of sweat)<strong> by means of</strong> pulling a plow.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hornlo">hornlo</a>] 13-10-2010(4): [ <strong>by means of</strong> = <em>plow</em> + <em>drop</em> + <em>person</em> ] - <strong>by means of</strong> a <em>plow</em> and a <em>drop</em> of sweat, a <em>person</em> can make a living.
