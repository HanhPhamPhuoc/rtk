heisig: "<i>Slave</i> . . . <i>reclining</i> . . . <i>goods</i>. The key word suggests both <b>looking</b> ahead <b>to</b> something and "seeing to" what is at hand. Consistent with everything we have learned about the role of the key word, this means that you must choose ONE meaning and stick to it."
