heisig: "The primitive for <i>woman</i> is on the left (there and at the bottom of another primitive is where you will always find her), and to the right the element for <i>few</i>. When we refer to a <i>woman</i> as <b>exquisite</b>, we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but <i>few</i> and far between. If you are interested in etymologies, it might help to recall that the Latin phrase lying at the root of the English word <b>exquisite</b> carries this same sense of &quot;seeking out&quot; the rare from the ordinary."
