## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 11-12-2007(286): &quot;<em>Flesh</em> in all <em>directions</em>&quot; =<strong> obese</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 6-9-2007(149): Yo momma so<strong> obese</strong>, she changed the direction of the moon.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sfekas">sfekas</a>] 28-6-2008(51): Yo momma so<strong> obese</strong>, she made the moon change direction. (I like DrWarrior12&#039;s story, but switched the words to match the kanji.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chadokoro_K">Chadokoro_K</a>] 11-9-2007(16): <strong>animal fat / +fat</strong> ----- BODY PART [FLESH], DIRECTION [COMPASS] ** Hint: Animal FLESH can contain a lot of <strong>ANIMAL FAT</strong>, so you point a special &quot;<strong>fat</strong>-measuring COMPASS&quot; at it to measure how much <strong>FAT</strong> it contains. ... Note: this does not mean &quot;obese,&quot; nor is it used in compound words meaning<strong> obese</strong>. It is always used together with &quot;shi&quot; in &quot;shibou&quot; for various types of &quot;fats.&quot; [D2060].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 30-3-2011(15): In response to DrWarrior12: Yo&#039; mama&#039;s so<strong> obese</strong>, I needed a <em>compass</em> to navigate her round <em>flesh</em> last night. :P.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 10-10-2007(15): &quot;Flesh in all directions &quot; is my motto for<strong> OBESE</strong> people. (thanx george!).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 16-11-2008(11): I followed Chadokoro_K&#039;s lead and renamed this one <strong>fatty</strong>, since it always seems to appear in words that involve animal fat, such as 脂肪質 (しぼうしつ) &#039;fatty&#039;, 脂肪酸 (しぼうさん) &#039;fatty acid&#039;, 脂肪油 (しぼうゆ) &#039;fatty oil&#039;, and 脂肪肝 (しぼうかん) &#039;fatty liver&#039;. Some overweight people seem to have in their FLESH a COMPASS that points to the <strong>fattiest</strong> foods (burgers, fries, etc..).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki">applesuki</a>] 26-2-2007(9): The<strong> obese</strong> person has a built in food compass which is constantly pointing to the closest source of meat (think McD&#039;s hamburgers).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adamrandell1296">adamrandell1296</a>] 10-11-2012(6): Yo moma&#039;s so<strong> obese</strong>, when I was navigating her <em>flesh</em> last night I had to ask for <em>directions</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alec_xvi">Alec_xvi</a>] 20-1-2011(4): That girl is so<strong> obese</strong> you need a COMPASS to get around her mounds of FLESH!
