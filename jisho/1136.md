## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 14-9-2007(244): [Based on fuaburisu&#039;s] A man puts some <em>rice</em> on a <em>fishhook</em> as bait, but catches a fish so strong, he needs to take out his <em>axe</em> and <strong>sever</strong> the line lest he be dragged into the depths. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marydj">marydj</a>] 25-10-2007(117): When you get the ax at work, use your<strong> severance</strong> pay to buy fishhooks and rice. At least that way you can eat sushi. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-5-2006(59): The <em>axe man</em> is fishing at a nearby river, using a <em>rice-ball on a hook</em> as bait. He catches some real big fish, which is pulling so hard on the line that <em>axe man</em> has to <strong>sever</strong> the line or let go of his pricey fishing rod. And at the same time there is the idea of<strong> severance</strong> in <em>axe man</em> having to let go of his big catch. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 28-3-2012(53): Your manager brings you into his office and offers you three<strong> severance</strong> packages. You can take the <em>hook</em> (become a fisherman), take the <em>rice</em> (become a farmer), or take the <em>axe</em> (become a lumberjack). Picture the items laid out on his desk like the shopkeepers in Zelda. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 6-10-2008(23): After he got <em>hooked</em> on <em>rice</em> wine the Japanese salaryman got the <em>axe</em> at work. Now all he has to live on is serverance pay. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skimalodeon">skimalodeon</a>] 13-1-2010(12): We have been <strong>severed</strong> from our traditional way off life in nature, which was based on fishing (with <em>fishooks</em>!), growing <em>rice</em>, and chopping down trees with <em>axes</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavisMcDavis">DavisMcDavis</a>] 30-3-2009(9): In Japan, workers get a very sensible<strong> severance</strong> package to make sure no one goes hungry once they are fired. The<strong> severance</strong> package consists of a fish hook, rice to put on the fish hook to use as bait, and an axe to chop off the fish&#039;s head after you catch it. (The only thing that&#039;s not included is a fish.). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 17-10-2009(5): <strong>Severance</strong> is the small payoff you get (just enough to buy some fish hooks and rice) after being given the <em>axe</em>. (thanks robertmyers!). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 11-1-2008(5): A factory worker is scooping <em>rice</em> into convenience-store bento boxes. Carelessly, he lets a <em>fish hook</em> fall into one of the bentos. A poor customer (you?) eats the bento and chomps down on the fish hook. Ouch! You sue the company and the factory worker gets the <em>axe</em>, immediately leaving but with<strong> severance</strong> pay. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 15-2-2013(2): This<strong> severance</strong> pay is nothing if not imaginative. A <em>fishhook</em> to catch fish, some <em>rice</em> and an <em>axe</em> to chop firewood and build a shelter. Got to laugh really or else I&#039;d cry, one day your a high flying investment banker in London...
