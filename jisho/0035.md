heisig: "A <i>walking stick</i> is needed for <i>days</i> of <b>olden times</b>, since <i>days</i>, too, get old - at least insofar as we refer to them as the "good old days." The main thing here is to think of "good old days" when you hear the key word <b>olden times</b>. The rest will take care of itself."
