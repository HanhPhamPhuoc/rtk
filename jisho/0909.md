Metal . . . to drop.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 17-6-2006(282): <strong>Iron</strong> is a<em> metal</em> that gradually becomes <em>lost</em> due to oxidation and rust.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 20-10-2008(105): Compare with <a href="../v4/270">pig-iron</a> (#270 銑). In moving from <strong>pig-iron</strong> to<strong> iron</strong>, some of the <em>metal&#039;s</em> maleability is <em>LOST</em>. (The only difference between the two kanji is that<strong> IRON</strong> has knee-less, unbending legs, while PIG-IRON (270) has very supple, bendable legs.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thermal">thermal</a>] 10-6-2008(52): <strong>Iron</strong> man will never lose.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 13-6-2008(37): I accidentally <em>dropped</em> a bucket of molten<strong> iron</strong> on my husband one day at the factory. He died instantly, but I didn&#039;t know what to do with his remains. Somehow an art collector heard about my plight and offered me three million in <em>gold</em> for my &quot;masterpiece&quot;. He called it<strong> Iron</strong> Man. So all because of a bucket of molten<strong> iron</strong>, I gained some <em>gold</em> and <em>lost</em> a husband.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjisensei">kanjisensei</a>] 25-10-2009(15): <strong>Iron</strong> weights a lot. It&#039;s a metal that&#039;s easy to drop.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 24-3-2008(13): Pumping<strong> iron</strong> at the gym will make you <em>lose</em> your fat.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 29-1-2009(12): <strong>Iron</strong>, compared to <a href="../v4/270">pig-iron</a> (#270 銑), has <em>lost</em> most of its carbon in the refining process. This makes it less brittle and a lot easier to use.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 31-3-2010(11): <strong>Iron</strong> is a <em>metal</em> that is <em>drop</em> forged.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg">sethg</a>] 31-3-2009(10): Because<strong> Iron</strong> Man is made of <em>metal</em>, he&#039;ll never <em>lose</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 31-5-2007(5): Drop Forged.
