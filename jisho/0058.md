## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 21-8-2007(169): A <em>magic wand</em> is needed to make a <em>clam</em> stand<strong> upright</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 2-5-2008(121): Just the thought of my <em>magic wand</em> on her <em>clam</em> makes my <em>magic wand</em> stand<strong> upright</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 16-12-2007(61): 貞 【てい】 (n) (1) firm adherence to one&#039;s principles; (2) chastity (of a woman) what this has to do with &quot;upright&quot;... not sure. but heres a story for CHASTITY: &quot;a magician uses his MAGIC WAND to shut the crotch of a maiden as tight as a CLAM, to protect her CHASTITY&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 16-1-2008(28): To get the <em>shellfish</em> to stand<strong> upright</strong>, just poke it with a <em>magic wand</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 12-1-2009(17): An<strong> UPRIGHT</strong> person is <em>above</em> ( 上 ) petty disputes, and always holds their head <em>up</em> ( 上 ). Since they live on principle, they are as hard or firm as a <em>shell</em> in their beliefs of what is right and what is wrong. They are wise, because they find the pearls of wisdom in the <em>shells</em> of life; 童貞 (virginity); 不貞 (unfaithful); 貞はる (harp too long on a subject); 貞淑 (chastity, virtue); 貞女 (virtuous woman); 不貞寝 (stay in bed out of spite); .

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narazumono">narazumono</a>] 27-8-2008(10): Eating <em>shellfish</em> will make your <em>magic wand</em> stand<strong> upright</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/symphony">symphony</a>] 20-8-2009(6): &quot;Wingardium Leviosa!&quot; I yelled, pointing my <em>magic wand</em> at the clam (<em>shellfish</em>). It jumped<strong> upright</strong> and danced.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek">peepiceek</a>] 28-4-2008(6): The chaste maiden used her magic wand to escape from the evil shellfish gang. [ 貞 【てい】 (n) (1) firm adherence to one&#039;s principles; (2) chastity (of a woman)] (thanks to romanrozhok for the definition).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bievalicious">bievalicious</a>] 17-2-2011(5): Careful! This means <strong>upright in character</strong>, not in position. So although the magically standing shellfish is a cute image, it doesn&#039;t convey the right meaning. This character is mainly used to represent a woman&#039;s chastity, purity or fidelity, so I just associate <em>chastity</em> with <em>magic oyster</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DarkOneSS">DarkOneSS</a>] 2-1-2009(5): To stand<strong> UPRIGHT</strong> your EYES must be ABOVE your LEGS.
