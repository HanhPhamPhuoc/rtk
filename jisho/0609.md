3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wizard">Wizard</a>] 13-8-2008(49): Newton realised the<strong> concept</strong> when he was sitting under a <em>tree</em>, and an apple smacked him in the head. He stood up, <em>eyes</em> wide, <em>heart</em> racing, for he had discovered gravity! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint">Clint</a>] 23-7-2008(39): When you find a<strong> concept</strong> that really moves you, such as the <strong>concepts</strong> of mercy, forgiveness and compassion, the reason they do so is the fact that the mental component of these <strong>concepts</strong> <em>inter-</em>act with your <em>heart</em> (to avoid mixing up the keywords for idea and<strong> concept</strong>, remember: <em>sound</em> idea, <em>inter-</em>esting<strong> concept</strong>). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zodiac">zodiac</a>] 6-11-2008(29): When you finally manage to explain a difficult<strong> concept</strong> to someone, it feels as if your <em>hearts</em> are <em>inter-</em>connected. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 6-6-2006(27): The mathematical<strong> concept</strong> was so difficult to grasp, the student grabbed his <em>wooden</em> pencil and stabbed himself in the <em>eye</em> and through the <em>heart</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 17-2-2008(7): This one&#039;s for Philosophy students. A very Habermasian kanji, this one.<strong> Concept</strong>s are inter-subjective constructs, the objects of communicative action. They go from person to person, from heart-to-heart, really. <em>Inter-heart</em> construct is pretty much how Habermas understands<strong> concept</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/killtheclock">killtheclock</a>] 5-2-2009(6): Die <strong>Idee</strong> der Liebe beruht auf <em>Herzen</em> die <em>einander</em> haben - quasi eins sind.
