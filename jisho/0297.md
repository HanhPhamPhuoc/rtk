## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aevangelica">aevangelica</a>] 18-7-2007(152): Cross-road.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tanaquil">tanaquil</a>] 28-4-2007(57): This kanji appears in the remarkable compound, 辻斬り 【つじぎり】 (n): killing a passerby in order to test a new sword. Imagine a <em>cross</em> by the <em>road</em>, at a busy<strong> crossing</strong>, marking the spot of the unfortunate passerby&#039;s death.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 4-8-2008(43): A<strong> crossing</strong> is where the ROAD makes a CROSS with another road. Easy.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vinniram">vinniram</a>] 10-12-2009(29): Why is there an extra drop on this website, but in the book there is no extra drop?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hotkiller123">hotkiller123</a>] 18-1-2009(13): <em>Cross</em>-<em>road</em> --&gt;<strong> CROSSING</strong> The extra drop is a <em>drop of blood</em> on the road because of the many accidents that happen there. (Addition to aevangelica&#039;s story to explain the extra drop.).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phaedrine">phaedrine</a>] 15-10-2012(11): A<strong> crossing</strong> is the place where you <em>cross</em> the <em>road-way</em>. (For those wondering, the extra drop is a font issue. The new JIS list defines this character as having two drops [which is why your font shows it that way], while Jouyou doesn&#039;t list this character [but also doesn&#039;t show any characters that use the two drop version]. Either way is considered acceptable, so choose whichever one you prefer. More info here: <a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=4627">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=4627</a> ).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bluedragon123">bluedragon123</a>] 17-2-2011(5): A<strong> crossing</strong> with <em>ten</em> <em>roads</em> are sure to bring forth a <em>drop</em> of sweat....

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 17-8-2007(4): Ten roads come together to form a mega-crossing.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alphador">alphador</a>] 8-1-2010(3): ATTRAVERSARE la STRADA all&#039;INCROCIO.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 19-6-2009(3): In Cormac McCarthy&#039;s &quot;The<strong> Crossing</strong>&quot;, Billy <em>crosses</em> over into Mexico several times, and only a <em>drop</em> of blood is spilled in comparison to other McCarthy novels, like &quot;The <em>Road</em>&quot;.
