## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 24-1-2007(25): Ancient Japanese officials collected their<strong> salarium</strong> in the shrines. A priest would collect their <em>rice grains</em> with a <em>broom</em>, and sweep it unto the <em>altar</em>, where the officials could collect their rice.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 20-2-2008(11): Rather than cold hard cash, the <em>rice</em> that the <em>altar</em> boys could <em>sweep</em> up became their<strong> salarium</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 21-2-2010(5): Since rice was a form of currency back then, <em>altar</em> boys in the Catholic Church used to <em>sweep up</em> and collect the <em>rice grains</em> after a wedding, and considered it their<strong> salarium</strong> in exchange for their underage sex services.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-5-2009(4): The<strong> salarium</strong> for the Japanes army is not money. They are paid with <em>videotapes</em> (录, see record <a href="../1144">record</a> (#1144 録). The higher the rank, the longer and dirtier the film :-).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shonb6570">Shonb6570</a>] 12-5-2011(2): This word is obsolete - It comes from the Roman era when soldiers were paid with salt, or rather, &quot;salarium argentum&quot;, which means something like &quot;salt money&quot;. Incoincidentally, it is where the term, &quot;Worth your salt&quot; comes from. Heisig&#039;s word choice for some of these is asinine. The Kanji means &quot;salary&quot; or &quot;stipend&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 6-11-2010(2): 禄高 , 禄 =祿 <a href="../2602">salarium</a> (#2602 禄) ロク( 録 ) old version ... Parts: ⺭, 录 (cf 緑 <a href="../1371">green</a> (#1371 緑), 剥く <a href="../2145">peel off</a> (#2145 剥), 収録 <a href="../1144">record</a> (#1144 録) ） ... Story: The samurai&#039;s stipend ( 禄高 ) was paid in rice in times of old, but the <em>Altar</em> boys got their<strong> Salarium</strong> by sweeping up the overspill of <em>Rice grains</em> wit a little <em>Broom</em>. (I have the Videotape of the Altar boys doing just that.).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 23-7-2010(1): At the local <em>altar</em>, a <em>curling</em> team is complaining to the officials that their <strong>salarium</strong> is paid in salt -- it has a bad effect on the game.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(1): <em>Indiana Jones</em> worked his way up from sweeping up <em>rice grains</em> with a <em>broom</em> for a small<strong> salarium</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sunspot">Sunspot</a>] 10-7-2011(): The catholic priest was caught on video tape paying a<strong> salarium</strong> to one of the altar boys, which as we all know caused a huge scandal in the media.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 18-5-2009(): This may be of interest to some. [录 [lù] verb - record; write down; copy; videotape] (<a href="http://www.nciku.com/search/zh/detail/%E5%BD%95/25596">http://www.nciku.com/search/zh/detail/%E5%BD%95/25596</a>) The web address shows the 录 part of the kanji with meanings and examples.
