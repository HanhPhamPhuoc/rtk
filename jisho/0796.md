## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 22-6-2008(153): You won first<strong> PRIZE</strong> in a <em>shell-fish</em> eating contest. Unfortunately you spent the whole night in the <em>outhouse</em> after. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 19-5-2007(123): As a<strong> prize</strong> for being the 1,000,000th person to use the restaurant&#039;s <em>outhouse</em>, I got all the <em>clams</em> I could eat. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-5-2006(114): This is a bit silly.. or maybe not only a bit, but.. You know some foodstuffs (cereals come to mind) sometimes have<strong> prize</strong>s mixed in them? Well, in this case, the<strong> prize</strong> was a shell (money, remember) and you only notice in the outhouse... (see also <a href="../904">secret</a> <span class="index">(#904 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/秘">秘</a>)</span>). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 21-2-2007(46): You win! Your<strong> prize</strong> is an <em>outhouse</em> filled with <em>shellfish</em>! (Just imagine the disbelief of the contestant...). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dinmamma">dinmamma</a>] 14-8-2009(20): Winning the Nobel<strong> prize</strong> gives you <em>ESTEEM ON TOP OF MONEY</em>. (this helps you remember the layout of the kanji too.). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gendal">Gendal</a>] 25-2-2009(14): Your<strong> PRIZE</strong> after eating the bad <em>shellfish</em> was a trip to the <em>outhouse</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cygnus">Cygnus</a>] 15-3-2008(14): He was just minding his own business, doing his business (in the <em>outhouse</em>), and suddenly a load of money (<em>shells</em>) appeared underneath him. A voice from outside exclaimed: &quot;You&#039;ve won a<strong> prize</strong>! You&#039;re the one millionth person to sit on this commode and answer nature&#039;s call! How do you feel?&quot; &quot;Suddenly constipated,&quot; he answered. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/norton">norton</a>] 20-3-2013(13): An <em>outhouse</em> filled with <em>shellfish</em>. Worst.<strong> Prize</strong>. Ever. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 27-11-2008(13): The<strong> prize</strong> for <em>Employee</em> of the Month at our shellfish company is a tiara or <em>small crown</em> . Only the office girls will wear it however, the fishermen refuse! [Thanks to Uber Climber for this idea... the outhouse stories just weren&#039;t working for me for this frame.]. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 19-5-2011(7): The 3 pronged roof resembles that on the character for   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/尚">尚</a>  <a href="../184">esteem</a> <span class="index">(#184 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/尚">尚</a>)</span>. Thus, I call this radical as &quot;an esteemed house&quot; instead of &quot;outhouse.&quot;......... A<strong> prize</strong> entail a rise in social esteem and some money..........   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/賞">賞</a>   = しょう = award.
