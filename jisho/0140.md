heisig: "Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling <b>spring</b> of <i>water</i>, and you will probably notice how the top of the <b>spring</b> you are thinking of, the part where the &quot;bubbling&quot; goes on, is all <i>white</i>. Happily, the <i>white</i> is just where it should be, at the top, and the <i>water</i> is at the bottom. We will keep this image of a SPRING when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for water) are abbreviated to the three small DROPS that we learned earlier as the kanji for LITTLE, giving us: XXX.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea">lilpea</a>] 3-8-2007(181): <em>White</em> is a symbol of purety, so <em>white</em> <em>water</em> is pure water, the precise definition of<strong> spring</strong> water.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hikarudo">hikarudo</a>] 19-8-2008(123): Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot<strong> spring</strong>. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot<strong> spring</strong>: a little <em>white</em> towel on top, <em>water</em> below. (This helps keep all associations:<strong> spring</strong>, little and onsen).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 18-2-2008(43): A fresh<strong> SPRING</strong> has plenty of frothy <em>white</em> bubbles in its crisp, cool <em>water</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 3-2-2008(23): A<strong> spring</strong> has <em>white</em> frothy <em>water</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akane99">akane99</a>] 8-7-2010(7): When<strong> SPRING</strong> comes, <em>white</em> snow melts and becomes <em>water</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aardwolf">aardwolf</a>] 26-12-2008(7): A<strong> spring</strong> is where pure <em>white</em> <em>water</em> comes from.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 3-3-2008(7): A <em>drop</em> of <em>sun</em> on the <em>water</em> signals the first day of<strong> spring</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 13-12-2008(5): Don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/1568">springtime</a> (#1568 春) bottom part is still mizu and not shou. a white water<strong> spring</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vicnet">vicnet</a>] 21-7-2009(4): <em>Water</em> coming out of a <strong>spring</strong> shoots up <em>white</em>. You need full force <em>water</em> for that, not just three drops or something.
