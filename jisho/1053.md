## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 5-1-2008(237): Animals use their<strong> urine</strong> to mark their territory. So for them, their body <em>water</em> works as a <em>flag</em> denoting their &quot;country&quot; (<em>why bother? we all know which story you are going to pick</em>).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 15-9-2006(128): Someone is pissing on the American flag, but since the<strong> urine</strong> is clear it looks like water.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 23-5-2008(80): The flag primitive looks like a big &quot;P&quot;. And, let&#039;s face it,<strong> urine</strong> is just pee water. So, &quot;Urine = <em>P Water</em>&quot;. Yes, it&#039;s stupid, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;m gonna forget it now, haha. (I renamed the flag primitive &quot;pee&quot;, it makes for unforgettable stories).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 27-7-2007(30): Animals use<strong> urine</strong> as a &quot;watery flag&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 20-8-2008(22): <strong>Urine</strong> is <em>water</em> that <em>flags</em> your territory.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 29-12-2006(15): In New York there was a controversial art piece consisting of an <em>American flag</em> soaked in<strong> urine</strong>... Rudolf Guliani wanted to ban it but I just think it is <em>watered</em> down art.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nisshawn">Nisshawn</a>] 8-11-2009(9): P water is<strong> urine</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 29-12-2007(6): The primitive placement here is important. So it&#039;s about peeing _under_ the <em>national flag</em>. Think of some patriotic guy who every morning raises the flag and then <em>waters</em> the area under it.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 13-5-2013(4): <strong>Urine</strong> is used by animals to <em>flag</em> an area as belonging to them, that is, their territory. This kanji shows<strong> urine</strong> being used to <em>flag</em> a particularly important piece of territory, the <em>water</em>ing hole. Just how important it is, is highlighted by having the <em>flag</em> over the full <em>water</em> kanji, rather than just using the <em>water</em> primitive.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KeshaFran">KeshaFran</a>] 29-11-2010(4): Animals <em>flag</em> their territory by <em>watering</em> a spot with their<strong> urine</strong>.
