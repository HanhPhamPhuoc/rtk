## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 11-11-2005(285): One sneaky farmer wanted to<strong> amass</strong> a large collection of livestock. We all know that cows like to eat flowers, so he planted lines of flowers leading to his own fields. The livestock followed the lines, eating the flowers one by one, and<strong> amass</strong>ed in his field.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 17-12-2006(28): It may seem illogical, but the fact is, you need to plant <strong>flowers</strong> if your aim is to <em>amass</em> <strong>livestock</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 31-5-2011(21): To keep the difference between<strong> amass</strong> and <a href="../559">gather</a> (#559 集) and <a href="../1364">accumulate</a> (#1364 累), I emphasize the MASS. To<strong> amass</strong> MASSIVE <em>livestock</em>, always feed them <em>flowers</em>. They&#039;ll get nice and plump. 蓄え = たくわえ = store; reserve; stock; savings.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 29-2-2008(18): Farmers in Japan grow flowers in the summer and rear livestock in the winter, in this way they<strong> amass</strong> a fortune.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanji_nightmare">kanji_nightmare</a>] 12-9-2008(12): I<strong> amass</strong>ed so many flowers from my many boyfriends, I had to feed them to my livestock to get rid of them.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-2-2008(7): Linking this story with the previous one, you <strong>amassed</strong> a whole lot of the <em>mysterious thing</em>, which after applied on your <em>rice field</em> has made it full of <em>flowers</em>! Now you can<strong> amass</strong> a fortune selling them. As a lesson, to<strong> amass</strong> a fortune, you must not be afraid of getting your hands dirty.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 4-3-2007(5): The farmer <strong>amass</strong>ed a lot of <em>flowers</em> to feed his livestock. That&#039;s flower grown livestoock, it&#039;s the new big thing in japan, or so I&#039;ve heard. (Careful <a href="../1364">accumulate</a> (#1364 累)).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 27-3-2010(4): For anyone who has seen a field where livestock have grazed for too long, you might have seen cowpen daisy, a flower which livestock dislike eating. When livestock graze a field too long, the field tends to<strong> amass</strong> huge amounts of this flower (the only plant not eaten) to the point where it will be the only thing growing there in the summer. Although a weed, it&#039;s really quite pretty.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/swiftman">swiftman</a>] 30-7-2009(4): <strong>Amass</strong>ing a bunch of tasty flowers, <em>gandalf</em> lured all the <em>livestock</em> to a safer location.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 14-10-2010(3): If you want to<strong> amass</strong> a fortune, it&#039;s clear that growing crops (<em>flowers</em>, grass, vegetation) is superior to raising <em>livestock</em>. 蓄える たくわえる to store; 貯蓄 ちょちく savings.
