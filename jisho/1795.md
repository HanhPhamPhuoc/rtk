Noah kept plenty of <em>salad</em> on board to entice the animals with their <em>animal legs</em> to scurry on board<strong> together</strong>, two by two. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 18-9-2007(64): The conjoined twins, who are always<strong> together</strong>, have trouble eating<strong> together</strong> because one is a vegetarian, eating <em>salad</em> and the other is a avid meat eater, eating <em>chicken legs</em>.[Thanks fuaburisu!]. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 13-10-2006(28): Imagine yakitori with <em>animal legs</em> and <em>salad</em> skewered on<strong> together</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(22): <em>Salad</em> and <em>animal legs</em> just go<strong> together</strong>. This primitive means <em>chicken caesar salad</em>. <a href="http://www.kfc.com/menu/salads.asp">http://www.kfc.com/menu/salads.asp</a>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 22-11-2005(4): As a primitive, I use the image of a creature with two heads, such as an <em>ettin</em>. You could also use the image of conjoined twins (call them <em>together twins</em>). The idea is of two persons who are always<strong> together</strong>.
