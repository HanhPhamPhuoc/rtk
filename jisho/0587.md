## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 4-1-2008(163): I guess this kanji proves it&#039;s not just the Welsh whose idea of<strong> beauty</strong> is a <em>large</em> <em>sheep</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 25-7-2007(75): A <em>Sheep</em> on top of a <em>dog</em> is NOT a <strong>beautiful</strong> thing.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 15-6-2008(55): Who is more beautiful, a <em>sheep</em> or a <em>st. Bernhard dog</em>? Imagine a big contest with many judges, then let the sheep win, since it is on top in the kanji (perhaps even let the <em>sheep</em> ride on the <em>st. Bernhard dog</em> because it won).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 23-8-2007(42): Sheep dogs are <strong>beautiful</strong> animals.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-2-2007(23): (Image: a bunch of <em>big sheep</em> in a<strong> beauty</strong> pageant, bikinis and evening dresses and all).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 23-6-2008(16): To a New Zealander/Welshman, what has more<strong> beauty</strong> than a big sheep?

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 12-6-2008(16): That sheep&#039;s a<strong> beauty</strong>! Look how large she is!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 10-12-2007(12): When you think of<strong> beauty</strong>, you must think of<strong> beauty</strong> sleep. How do you get to sleep? By counting <em>sheep.</em> But if you are truly sleepy, you will only have to count one <em>large</em> sheep before you doze off.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 20-6-2009(7): Women follow<strong> beauty</strong> trends like <em>sheep</em>, always chasing the next <em>big</em> thing.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NinKenDo">NinKenDo</a>] 11-11-2012(6): Warning! This is not Sheep + Big as the stroke order does not match! To avoid confusing the stroke order, use Horns + King + Big. For your story! My story is this: When the horny king was exposed to true<strong> beauty</strong>, he suddenly felt as though his pants were not big enough.
