## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-8-2006(181): I imagine thomeone who can not pronounth the &quot;s&quot; and<strong> speaketh</strong> like thith becauth they have a <em>cane</em> in their <em>mouth</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 14-2-2008(90): I had persistent trouble confusing this one with 曰 <a href="../578">sayeth</a> (#578 曰). The way I keep it sorted out is that this one is used in &quot;moshi moshi&quot; when answering the phone, similar to the way an American would say &quot;hello, this is X <strong>speaking</strong>.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark">mistamark</a>] 26-10-2008(61): The <em>cross</em> in the <em>mouth</em> of the <em>Monkey</em> ensured it<strong> speaketh</strong> no evil.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 26-5-2007(21): A MONKEY can&#039;t<strong> SPEAKETH</strong> of anything if he has a WALKING STICK driven through his TOUNGE WAGGING IN HIS MOUTH.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/furrykef">furrykef</a>] 2-7-2008(14): Distinguished from <a href="../578">sayeth</a> (#578 曰) in that we&#039;re surprised that the <em>monkey</em> can speak at all: &quot;The monkey<strong> speaketh</strong>!&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deborah">Deborah</a>] 14-1-2008(11): To<strong> speaketh</strong> in is to <strong>say humbly</strong>. The <em>monkey</em><strong> speaketh</strong> no evil, that is why his <em>mouth</em> is covered with <em>cross</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 4-1-2008(11): I&#039;m surprised no one has posted this yet: If you do not<strong> speaketh</strong> in humble to your Japanese boss you will get a walking stick jammed right through your mouth as its wagging its tongue (talking). for the primitive, imagine the monkey from Aladdin stealing some brains on a stick with Aladdin! Recent events in the middle east have really made the countries people struggling to survive thanks to Bush.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(6): How can he<strong> speaketh</strong> with a <em>walking stick</em> jammed through his <em>wagging tongue</em>?

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(5): The &quot;moshi-moshi monkey&quot;<strong> speaketh</strong> no evil -- he cannot pronounth the &quot;s&quot; and<strong> speaketh</strong> like thith becauth he hath a cane through hith wagging tongue .....[thanks fuaburisu, mcfate and mistamark].

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 12-10-2008(5): Primitive MONKEY....We have to avoid confusing it with 曰 <a href="../578">sayeth</a> (#578 曰). So, we memorize this: HE SAYETH THAT THE MONKEY<strong> SPEAKETH</strong> !!
