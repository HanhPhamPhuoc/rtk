## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kieron">Kieron</a>] 3-7-2007(295): Your <strong>earnings</strong> allow you to bring <em>home</em> your daily bread (made of <em>wheat</em>, naturally). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 25-4-2008(85): Hmm,<strong> EARNINGS</strong>. Think of the popular saying &quot;Bringing HOME the bacon&quot;. Here,<strong> EARNINGS</strong> is the picture &quot;Bringing HOME the bread(WHEAT) and the bacon (PIG). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 10-4-2007(37): A farmer&#039;s<strong> earnings</strong> can be viewed as the amount of wheat he has in his grain silo (house). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-3-2007(30): <strong>Earnings</strong>? Where I&#039;m from, it&#039;s called bringing <em>home</em> the <em>dough</em>... 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jinkouchinou">jinkouchinou</a>] 3-8-2009(14): The breadwinner (<em>wheat</em> bread winner) brings <em>home</em> the<strong> earnings</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 28-10-2009(10): Your<strong> earnings</strong> are wheat you bring home... 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivantolearnkanji">ivantolearnkanji</a>] 24-12-2007(8): We need to differentiate between<strong> earnings</strong> and profits. In corporate finance,<strong> earnings</strong> is usually &quot;earnings before interest and taxes&quot; or EBIT. By contrast, <a href="../906">profit</a> <span class="index">(#906 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/利">利</a>)</span> is an after-tax measurement. And so, the wheat we bring home (we are paid in bushels of wheat) represents our<strong> earnings</strong>. But we won&#039;t eat it all... 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/libsrone">libsrone</a>] 19-5-2008(5): One of the three little pigs, saving up its<strong> earnings</strong> to move into a <em>wheat house</em>. (Right now it lives in a house made of Kashi). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/walexander5">walexander5</a>] 11-7-2008(4): If the farmer cant make enough<strong> earnings</strong> by selling his <em>grain</em>, he cant afford to keep the <em>house</em> (think of all the crappy movies where this happens). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 19-1-2008(4): All your<strong> earnings</strong> go to buy <em>wheat</em> to feed the <em>pig</em> in your <em>house</em> you thought it was such a great idea when it was just a little piglet...now it&#039;s eaning all your<strong> earnings</strong>.
