## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 24-12-2007(239): <em>Caveman</em> got <strong>ill</strong> after flying <em>third class</em>. The cabin air and food got to him. (Primitive: these all got MUCH easier when using <em>CAVEMAN</em> instead. ). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 5-2-2007(59): If you hang around a <em>third class</em> hospital, you&#039;ll get<strong> ill</strong> with the <em>sickness</em> everyone else has. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yorkii">yorkii</a>] 2-7-2006(27): Note: according to this <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/">http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/</a>~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwhalsod.cgi?3277_%C9%C2 the stroke order is different to that presented in the Heisig book. 4th and 5th strokes are reversed. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 12-7-2009(25): I have this female friend who complains about <em>third class</em> type stuff a lot. She&#039;ll say stuff like &#039;&#039;That train ride made me<strong> ill</strong>. Seriously,&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;Oh my god, sitting next that dirty guy made me<strong> ill</strong>. Seriously.&#039;&#039; Sometimes I just want to kick her in the cunt. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 28-2-2007(22): Hint: The<strong> ill</strong> in<strong> ill</strong> almost looks like the roman numeral <strong>III</strong>. Use as a hint to 3rd class. The<strong> ill</strong> are more abundant in <em>third class</em> countries (<em>third world</em>). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 26-1-2010(12): Sickness primitive: <strong>Geico caveman</strong>. The <em>caveman</em> is flying <em>third class</em> to escape all the commercials when suddenly a voiceover says &quot;Flying with Southwest, so easy a caveman could do it.&quot; The caveman is offended and gets<strong> ill</strong>, throwing up all over the nearby passengers. <em>Hint:</em><strong> ill</strong> looks like III. Third class. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 16-8-2009(4): On the airplane, they book all the <em>sick</em> passangers in <em>third class</em>, that way only the people there get<strong> ill</strong>. Swine flu here we come! 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 18-8-2011(3): Let<strong> ill</strong> connote a long-term <em>sickness</em>; the kind you might end up with in a <em>third-class</em> hospital. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc">mcbainpc</a>] 1-7-2008(3): <em>Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer</em> got <strong>ill</strong> after flying <em>third class</em>. The cabin air and food got to him. (Primitive: these all got MUCH easier when using <em>UNFROZEN CAVEMAN LAWYER</em> instead. ) (from dingomick). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Srdjan">Srdjan</a>] 2-9-2010(2): &quot;Motherfucker I&#039;m<strong> Ill</strong>, not sick.&quot;- Lil Wayne. Pretty much a third class rapper by some. Looks alot like a caveman too. Also, wears iced out chains all the time.
