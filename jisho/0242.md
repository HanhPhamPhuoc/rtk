heisig: "You've no doubt seen cattails, those swamp <b>reeds</b> with a furry <i>flower</i> to them like the tail of a cat. This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome <i>pack of wild dogs</i>: lure them into a swamp of these <b>reeds</b> with the cattail <i>flowers</i> and then set <i>fire</i> to the swamp. Take care to focus on the <i>flower</i> rather than the &quot;cattail&quot; to avoid confusion with frame 259 below."

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 8-10-2007(50): Picture a Gary Larson cartoon of a pack of <em>dogs</em> sitting around a <em>campfire</em>. They misunderstood something they overheard, and can&#039;t understand why they&#039;re not getting high smoking<strong> reed</strong>. In the kanji, you can actually see the dog smoking the<strong> reed</strong> in a crack pipe held over the fire. (Thanks, chamcham!).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anroo">anroo</a>] 12-7-2009(13): <strong>Reed</strong>s are a type of <em>flower</em> that can be used as a Snorkle, hiding in the swamp till danger has passed. This is especially useful when hiding from a <em>Pack of Wild dogs</em> and forest <em>fire</em>s.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kazuma">kazuma</a>] 17-5-2012(12): I turned 狄 into an element I call &quot;savages&quot; (&quot;savages&quot; are like a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> gathered around a <em>fire</em>. NOTE: 狄 is a kanji depicting a certain tribe of barbarians from northern China. Since both of those keywords have been used in the RTK series, I chose &quot;savages&quot;.<strong> Reed</strong>s are <em>flowers</em> that grow like <em>savages</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lozza">Lozza</a>] 17-8-2008(12): <strong>Reed</strong>s are plants that spread like wild fire.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 11-8-2008(5): You only have one<strong> reed</strong>, so you hover it over each dog&#039;s nose individually, eventually leading an entire <em>pack of dogs</em> into your <em>fire</em>. You can even see his nose sniffing the curious<strong> reed</strong>. Remember you must be very cautious, no sudden movements or else the whole pack will tear you to pieces.
