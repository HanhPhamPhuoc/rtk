heisig: "You've no doubt seen cattails, those swamp <b>reeds</b> with a furry <i>flower</i> to them like the tail of a cat. This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome <i>pack of wild dogs</i>: lure them into a swamp of these <b>reeds</b> with the cattail <i>flowers</i> and then set <i>fire</i> to the swamp. Take care to focus on the <i>flower</i> rather than the "cattail" to avoid confusion with frame 259 below."
