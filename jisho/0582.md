4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 28-12-2008(33): This kanji is also used for <strong>Australia</strong>. Think about it from Japan&#039;s point of view. On average Australians are taller than the Japanese. Australia is nominally a monarchy, indicated by the crown. As far as manners go, compared to the Japanese, typical ockers are pigs.

By the end he was walking <em>tall</em> and he basically <em>crowned</em> himself king of the farm...he forgot his roots, that he came from a lowly <em>sow</em>..

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 10-12-2007(17): Think of King Kong<strong> overpowering</strong> the <em>tall</em> buildings, only now it is a huge <em>sow</em> wearing a <em>crown</em> as she knocks over buildings with her pig hoofs.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Offshore">Offshore</a>] 28-4-2009(14): Imagine an extremely<strong> overpowering</strong> person. He is <em>taller</em> than anyone, wears a <em>crown</em>, and treats everyone else like a <em>pig</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo">rizzo</a>] 31-10-2005(10): Miss Piggy (my favourite<strong> overpowering</strong> <em>sow</em>) comes back, wearing a <em>crown</em> this time she&#039;s<strong> overpowering</strong> poor Kermit. Which is easy for her because she&#039;s so <em>tall</em> compared to him.
