5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 25-7-2010(8): You think it&#039;s<strong> difficult</strong> for you to learn kanji? Think about how<strong> difficult</strong> it would be for a turkey!

Turkeys also find it<strong> difficult</strong> to get along with Cabbage Patch Kids. The problem is that turkeys like to eat cabbage and Cabbage Patch Kids like to eat turkey!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/heisig">heisig</a>] 2-7-2008(6): This <em>Kanji</em> is<strong> difficult</strong>. It looks like <em>chicken (turkey)</em> scratch.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 11-2-2008(6): This level of Mario is really<strong> difficult</strong>. You got the huge Monster Flower and turkeys that fly around. You have to jump from one turkey on the other. The moment you jump on them they fall down and get eaten by the huge monster flower. Do this for about 40 times and the huge Monster flower will explode. Extremely<strong> difficult</strong>.
