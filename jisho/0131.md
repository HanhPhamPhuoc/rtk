heisig: "The appearance of the primitive for <i>water</i> in its full form tells us that we have something to do with <i>water</i> here. The extra <i>drop</i> to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a <i>walking stick</i> dropped into <i>water</i> to form an <b>icicle</b>. If it helps, when you hold an <b>icicle</b> up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji."
