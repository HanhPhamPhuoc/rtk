heisig: "The key word for this kanji connotes the &quot;muddying&quot; effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For example, in English a &quot;j&quot; is <b>voiced</b> while a &quot;sh&quot; is unvoiced. In Japanese, the し is changed to じ when it is <b>voiced</b>. The primitives are: <i>water</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>insect</i>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 28-6-2007(228): The fly is wrapped in a spiderweb voicing &quot;Help me, Help Me&quot; under the watchful eye of the spider who&#039;s venom is dripping like water from her fangs. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rhclaghorn">rhclaghorn</a>] 29-12-2007(153): Pour <em>water</em> over the <em>eyes</em> of a <em>bound up</em> <em>insect</em> if you want to hear a pitiful buzz that is very similar to a<strong> VOICED</strong> consanant. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 6-9-2007(52): This is how to produce<strong> voiced</strong> consonants, like Z: [1] use lots of saliva (<em>water</em>); [2] you can <em>see</em> the vibrating of the vocal chords in a mirror; [3] the sound is that of a zzzzooming <em>insect</em>, as if <em> bound up</em> in your throat. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 17-6-2006(41): <strong>Voiced</strong> here refers to the &quot;muddying&quot; effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For the image of muddy, we have an <em>insect</em> that is <em>bound up</em> and lowered into the <em>water</em> as bait. As it struggles for its life, it stirs up the sediment at the bottom, muddying the <em>water</em> such that your <em>eyes</em> cannot see through it. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 11-4-2010(28): My EYES WATERED when I got an INSECT BOUND UP in my throat, and all my consanants became<strong> VOICED</strong>.　ブッキング　インシェクト。。。. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theBryan">theBryan</a>] 12-9-2008(19): In Japanese , you can see whether a syllable is<strong> voiced</strong> or unvoiced by the dakuten marks. For example the unvoice shi sounds like water flowing ssssssshhhii but<strong> voiced</strong> ji sounds like a bunch of bound up insects buzzing like jjjjjjzzzzzzzzziiii. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 1-11-2010(16): This is a rather tragic pictograph of me trying to explain about<strong> voiced</strong> consonants to one of my phonics classes. All <em>eyes</em> gaze at me blankly (heads tilted quizzically) and I spray little drops of <em>water</em> (saliva) as I desperately try to explain about the buzzing <em>insect</em> which is <em>bound up</em> in your throat.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/清濁">清濁</a>   (せいだく) : good and evil, purity and impurity;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/濁る">濁る</a>   (にごる) : become muddy or impure. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 18-7-2009(14): In Japanese,<strong> voiced</strong> consonants are marked with a dakuten. A し has a soft sound, like flowing <em>water</em>. But, if you <em>eye</em> two little lines <em>bound</em> above it, you know it is a じ with a hard sound, like the chirping of an <em>insect</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gyouza">gyouza</a>] 26-9-2010(8): To illustrate what a <strong>voiced</strong> consonant is we have here <em>water</em> swooshing as an example of an un<strong>voiced</strong> sound, going like &quot;shhhhhhh&quot;, and in contrast the buzzing of an <em>insect</em> <em>bound up</em> in a <em>net</em> producing a <strong>voiced</strong> &quot;zzzzzzzz&quot;. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asriel">Asriel</a>] 18-3-2009(7): The spider<strong> voiced</strong> his his delight as his mouth <em>watered</em> as it <em>looked</em> at the <em>bound up insect</em> that it had in its web.
