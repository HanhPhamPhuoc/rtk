However,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/賠">賠</a>   is always used in conjunction   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/賠償">賠償</a>  ... But   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/償">償</a>   is used in various other compounds. <em>Mr. T</em> sold all his jewelry to give as<strong> reparation</strong>s to slave families.

What a guy!   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/補償">補償</a>   (ほしょう) : compensation,<strong> reparation</strong>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shuusaku">shuusaku</a>] 9-1-2013(11): CHUCK NORRIS received a huge PRIZE for the world karate championship, but he had to give it back to the organizers in<strong> REPARATION</strong> of the damages he did to the arena and to the other competitors [modified after etpan].

He was happy because he was paid <strong>reparations</strong> of about $10,000. He felt like he had won a <em>prize</em>. Sadly, a true story. <a href="../476">compensation</a> <span class="index">(#476 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/賠">賠</a>)</span> is a word the Mafia might use, and so means &quot;hush&quot; money, while <a href="../985">reparation</a> <span class="index">(#985 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/償">償</a>)</span> is more legalistic and so involves insurance claims. Focus on person and not leg for left radical. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rujiel">Rujiel</a>] 18-12-2009(7): &quot;Reparations?! Those <em>people</em> just want a cash <em>prize</em> for doing nothin&#039;!&quot; (Please don&#039;t take this seriously, it was the first thing that came to mind and stuck).
