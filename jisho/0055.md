heisig: "Now take the last primitive, the <i>shellfish</i>, and set a <i>magic wand</i> over it, and you have the kanji for <b>upright</b>. After all, the <i>clam</i> and the <i>oyster</i> are incapable of walking <b>upright</b>. It would take a magician with his <i>wand</i> to pull off such a feat - which is precisely what we have in this kanji."

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 12-1-2009(17): An<strong> UPRIGHT</strong> person is <em>above</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/上">上</a>  ) petty disputes, and always holds their head <em>up</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/上">上</a>  ). Since they live on principle, they are as hard or firm as a <em>shell</em> in their beliefs of what is right and what is wrong. They are wise, because they find the pearls of wisdom in the <em>shells</em> of life;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/童貞">童貞</a>   (virginity);   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/不貞">不貞</a>   (unfaithful);   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/貞はる">貞はる</a>   (harp too long on a subject);   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/貞淑">貞淑</a>   (chastity, virtue);   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/貞女">貞女</a>   (virtuous woman);   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/不貞寝">不貞寝</a>   (stay in bed out of spite); .

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/symphony">symphony</a>] 20-8-2009(6): &quot;Wingardium Leviosa!&quot; I yelled, pointing my <em>magic wand</em> at the clam (<em>shellfish</em>). It jumped<strong> upright</strong> and danced. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek">peepiceek</a>] 28-4-2008(6): The chaste maiden used her magic wand to escape from the evil shellfish gang. [  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/貞">貞</a>   【てい】 (n) (1) firm adherence to one&#039;s principles; (2) chastity (of a woman)] (thanks to romanrozhok for the definition). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bievalicious">bievalicious</a>] 17-2-2011(5): Careful! This means <strong>upright in character</strong>, not in position. So although the magically standing shellfish is a cute image, it doesn&#039;t convey the right meaning. This character is mainly used to represent a woman&#039;s chastity, purity or fidelity, so I just associate <em>chastity</em> with <em>magic oyster</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DarkOneSS">DarkOneSS</a>] 2-1-2009(5): To stand<strong> UPRIGHT</strong> your EYES must be ABOVE your LEGS.
