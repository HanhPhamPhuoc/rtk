heisig: Now take the last primitive, the <i>shellfish</i>, and set a <i>magic wand</i> over it, and you have the kanji for <b>upright</b>. After all, the <i>clam</i> and the <i>oyster</i> are incapable of walking <b>upright</b>. It would take a magician with his <i>wand</i> to pull off such a feat - which is precisely what we have in this kanji.
