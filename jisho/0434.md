They<strong> vie</strong> with one another, each trying to break the vase on their opponent&#039;s head. Imagine what happens to the loser when his vase breaks. To avoid confusion with &quot;contend&quot;, &quot;war&quot;, etc, remember that<strong> Vie</strong> and Vase both start with &quot;v&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rhclaghorn">rhclaghorn</a>] 26-12-2007(26): Twin <em>brothers</em> lined up side to side, each<strong> VIE</strong> to <em>stand</em> taller than the other.
