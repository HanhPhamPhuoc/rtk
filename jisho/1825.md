## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 29-9-2007(98): I took the<strong> compilation</strong> of covers of all my <em>Spider-Man</em> comics that I had saved in a <em>scrapbook</em> and glued them on my door. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DeKleft">DeKleft</a>] 3-12-2007(70): My <em>Spiderman comic book</em> <em><strong>compilation</strong></em> is almost complete...only one left, and I may have to kill for it... 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 31-5-2008(59): Whereas Mr.T was partial to KONBINI HENTAI, SPIDERMAN likes to wait for the<strong> COMPILATION</strong>. He finds it more convenient to have his hentai compiled in one volume to read on the loo. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 16-12-2008(18): <em>Spidey</em> has the <em>kanji poster</em>. A<strong> compilation</strong> of all RTK 1 kanji(See <a href="../1823">partial</a> <span class="index">(#1823 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/偏">偏</a>)</span> for <em>kanji poster</em>). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-3-2007(11): Did you hear about the new <em>Black Widow konibini hentai</em> <strong>compilation</strong>?! I&#039;m going to 7-11 right now to buy it. She&#039;s so hot! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 20-2-2007(9): Raulir has a good idea. I prefer to think of the manga<strong> compilation</strong>s as the individual comics (serials from the anthologies) bound together with a coarse thread down the spine, produced quickly and put on the market. Good way to recycle those pulpy manga, and since when has the consumer <em>not</em> gotten screwed in Japan? ;-). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asriel">Asriel</a>] 11-7-2009(8): <em>Mr. T</em> may like <em>hentai,</em> but his collection pales in comparison the the<strong> compilation</strong> that <em>Spiderman</em> has! No wonder he keeps his face hidden...in shame! 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 16-5-2006(7): In the SCRAPBOOK capitol of America, each resident is asked to post on their DOORS their best SCRAPBOOK page for one week. After that week, all of the pages are THREADed together into a giant<strong> COMPILATION</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-1-2007(5): A Japanese comic book is a<strong> compilation</strong> of the individual chapters (which have already appeared in weekly comic magazines) with a thread (story arc) going through it. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtachd">dtachd</a>] 1-3-2010(3): A <em>scrap book</em> is a<strong> compilation</strong> of pictures <em>thread</em>ed together between two <em>door</em>s(covers).
