## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(67): The <em>king</em> used <em>both hands</em> to<strong> tinker with</strong> himself in his spare time.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 12-6-2007(20): Picture the king holding a large pan in his two hands and tinkering with it, wishing he could lead the itinerant life of a tinker. As a rhyme: The <em>king</em>, he uses his <em>two hands</em>, To<strong> tinker with</strong> his pots and pans . . .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 9-11-2009(15): Tinker seems to imply mending or working at something, which is wrong. This is more like &quot;to trifle with&quot;. (The meaning of &quot;to trifle with&quot; is sufficiently different from &quot;trifle&quot; that there should be no confusion). The king can trifle with anything using his two hands (be it objects, his subjects, or himself).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(7): When something new is invented, the king is always the first to be able to<strong> tinker with</strong> it. So picture yourself looking up at the <em>king</em> with <em>both hands</em> holding your new invention, only to have it <strong>tinkered with</strong> and broken by the king who would say nothing more than &quot;oh dear&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 10-4-2007(5): The <em>king</em> wore jewels on <em>both hands</em> that had been <strong>tinkered with</strong> so that they contained poison.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 5-5-2011(2): A mechanic <strong>tinkers with</strong> the android <em>king</em>. Her <em>two hands</em> are <strong>tinkering away</strong> in his open skull as he sits on the throne. If only the public knew he was a robot!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 26-1-2011(2): - JESUS! If you are going to<strong> tinker with</strong> my <em>jewels</em>, at least use <em>two hands</em> - OK God. Gosh...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterHB">PeterHB</a>] 2-2-2013(1): The king was <strong>tinkering with</strong> his crown when he got both his <em>two hands</em> stuck in the gaps between the <em>jewels</em> of his crown.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alexis598">Alexis598</a>] 3-2-2012(1): Obscure reference, this reminds me of Tita from Trails in the Sky (RPG for PSP) she loved to<strong> tinker with</strong> the quartz (jewels) just don&#039;t forget she does it with her 2 hands!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 11-1-2012(1): The <em>king</em> was an infamous tinkerer, always <strong>tinkering with</strong> the mechanism of the state. Picture the king holding levers with <em>both hands</em> as if to control the economy.
