heisig: "Pardon me if I revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again, but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette. For instance, the fact that things like the <i>mouth</i> of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a <i>woman</i> gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a <b>likeness</b> to the <i>opening</i> of the <i>woman</i> from whom you were born."
