2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 17-6-2007(22): Yeah, all our <em>water</em> is fairly <em>mediocre</em>, but if we work together in some<strong> pan</strong>-continental union, we can make some better <em>water</em>! As if.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 9-6-2009(20): After<strong> Pan</strong>-Am crashed yet another plane into the <em>water</em>, their reputation dropped to <em>mediocre</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 14-7-2010(6): A person sneezes. The <em>water drops in the wind</em> are about to start a<strong> pan</strong>demic and put the whole world in<strong> pan</strong>demonium.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 30-7-2010(5): <strong>Pan-</strong>Am was such a lousy airline, even the <em>water</em> in their in-flight meals was <em>mediocre</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snzzbk">snzzbk</a>] 18-9-2009(5): I went to a Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy theme restaurant and ordered a <strong>pan-</strong>galactic gargleblaster, but what they gave me was just <em>water</em>ed-down, <em>mediocre</em> vodka.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alucardchuu">alucardchuu</a>] 3-1-2010(4): During a<strong> PAN</strong>demic disease, water quality is mediocre, better not drink it without boiling it first.
