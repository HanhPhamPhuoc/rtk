## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 31-1-2008(189): The <em>samurai</em> sitting on the <em>drum</em> is on a stage, and the people below him are <strong>rejoicing</strong> with their <em>mouths</em> in unison. It helps me to imagine the placement this way.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 13-3-2007(59): <strong>Rejoice</strong> with the sound of <em>drums</em> and <em>voice</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 5-9-2006(42): In the taiko (<a href="../1444">drum</a> (#1444 鼓)) song of rejoicing, the drummers shout with open mouths.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tummai">tummai</a>] 30-5-2008(30): <em>Ten</em> <em>beans</em> in my <em>mouth</em>! I was starving so this small meal is enough for me to<strong> rejoice</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 3-8-2008(23): Think Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Sir Robin&#039;s ministrals, following the group with their <em>drums</em>: &quot;One winter they had to eat (therefore the mouth) Robin&#039;s ministrals... and there was much <strong>rejoicing</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/efeilliaid">efeilliaid</a>] 30-9-2009(12): <strong>Rejoice</strong>! We caught that annoying drummer, threw away his drumstick (branch) and pushed the drum into his mouth.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samichan">Samichan</a>] 12-3-2011(7): I <strong>REJOICE</strong> because I have learned to <strong>drum</strong> using my <strong>mouth</strong> (beatboxing :D).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SwiftyFrisco">SwiftyFrisco</a>] 4-8-2010(6): He we see the start of Mr. <strong>Bean</strong>&#039;s Japan tour. He exists the plane dressed as a <strong>samurai</strong> and all the fans<strong> rejoice</strong> and start screaming (<strong>mouth</strong>). Picture Mr. Bean in full kimono exiting a plane at the top of some steps with all the fans at the bottom of the steps (helps with the positioning of the primitives).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matthewmuller">matthewmuller</a>] 23-11-2009(6): I<strong> rejoice</strong> that i have <em>ten beans </em> in my <em>mouth</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 25-6-2009(4): I hate drums, so I<strong> rejoice</strong> when the <em>samurai</em> puts down the branches and instead opens his <em>mouth</em> to sing. &quot;We&#039;re no strangers to love...&quot;.
