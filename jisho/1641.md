## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-3-2007(79): The<strong> remains</strong> consisted of a <em>skeleton</em> which had the<strong> remains</strong> of some <em>acorns</em> in its stomach area. Whether it died from eating the acorns<strong> remains</strong> to be seen.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 2-12-2008(41): Hint: The<strong> remains</strong> of a chipmunk.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 22-1-2009(18): (big ups to cameron_en) Whatever happened to Chip and Dale? We investigated their tree, and the only<strong> remains</strong> there were their <em>skeleton</em>s and a huge pile of <em>acorn</em>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 19-1-2010(10): Ultimately unsuccessful, all that<strong> REMAINS</strong> of Scrat (of Ice Age fame) is his SKELETON which is almost clutching the ever elusive ACORN.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 5-8-2010(4): After the BBQ, the there was no <em>sign of the hog</em> except the<strong> remains</strong> i.e. a <em>skeleton</em>. Careful with <a href="../v4/808">remainder</a> (#808 残).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(2): <em>Acorns</em> found among the <em>skeletons</em> of ancient<strong> remains</strong> suggest that nuts were a dietary staple.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 7-6-2012(1): <strong>Remains</strong> in a <em>skeleton</em> represent only the past, but the<strong> remains</strong> in an <em>acorn</em> can grow anew.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 9-2-2011(1): The<strong> remains</strong> of that cute little guy for Ice Age is just a <em>skeleton</em>. But we know it&#039;s his <em>skeleton</em>, because it is still clutching onto an <em>acorn</em>. Although he is gone, his spirit still<strong> remains</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(1): People always wonder why those <em>skeleton</em> enemies in Mario always come back after you jump on them. The truth is that every time they get crushed, they drop their core <em>acorn</em>, which contains all of their data and such. If this <em>acorn</em> is left there with their<strong> remains</strong> for more than a few seconds, it will come back to life. So if you want to make sure that those<strong> remains</strong> remain<strong> remains</strong>, you&#039;d better stoop down and throw away that acorn after you jump on a <em>skeleton</em>, Mario!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiwiburner">kiwiburner</a>] 23-4-2013(): The<strong> remains</strong> of my ex-wife are little more than a <em>skeleton</em> buried under some <em>acorns</em>. True story.
