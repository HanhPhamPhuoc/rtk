You can see his crown poking out and the brains splatter out the top of his head from all the pressure.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 20-6-2007(74): Making <strong>tatami mats</strong> from <em>rice field</em> waste was Japan&#039;s <em>crowning</em> achievement, but for some reason other countries just <em>shelved</em> the idea.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 8-3-2009(72): Rice Field + Crown + Shelf:<strong> Tatami mat</strong>s were used by everyone - from the workers in the <em>Rice fields</em> to the <em>crown</em> - and when they were not in used, they were put on the <em>shelf</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 16-7-2008(21): To rest on the<strong> tatami mat</strong>, he puts his BRAIN and CROWN on the SHELF. Dont forget to put it on again, when you leave!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(14): After a hard days work in the <em>rice field</em>, the humble king hung his <em>crown</em> upon his <em>shelf</em>, curled up on his<strong> tatami mat</strong>, and slept.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 18-9-2010(4): <strong>Tatami mat</strong>s, laid in a pattern like a <em>rice field</em>, <em>crowned</em> with a ribbon and stored away in a <em>bookcase</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 27-2-2009(4): The top field is actually a pictograph of<strong> tatami mat</strong>s, which are the crowning achievement in the trophy case of Japanese cultural wonders (that&#039;s a stretch, lol...).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BlackMarsh">BlackMarsh</a>] 15-2-2006(2): <strong>Tatami mat</strong>s are made from the left-over straw from rice fields, they are then woven and crowned so that they stick together properly, then placed on a shelf to age slightly before selling.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiHantaa">KanjiHantaa</a>] 14-4-2013(1): ¡Ah! La <strong>estera de tatami</strong> tiene restos de <em>cerebro</em> por doquier. A un infeliz le partió la <em>corona</em> la <em>estantería</em> que se le vino encima. ¡Qué enchastre!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nussram">nussram</a>] 23-7-2012(1): Tweak to the storiy ofDurablePants Last edited: 22-6-2006 The pretender to the throne is peacefully sleeping on his new<strong> tatami mat</strong> when all of a sudden a shelf falls over and kills him. You can see his crown poking out and the brains splatter out the top of his head from all the pressure. That’s what you get for pretending to be the monarch. (I took out &quot;king&quot; in order to obviate the possibility of including 王 by mistake.).
