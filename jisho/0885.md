## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 29-5-2007(136): Hearkening back to the kanji for LISTEN...<strong> Benevolence</strong> is a good <em>listener</em> who is willing to <em>go</em> the distance to help. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 29-4-2007(109): In a rare act of<strong> benevolence</strong>, the Sparten <em>column</em> removes the needle from the <em>cyclops&#039;s</em> eye, and he repays them by eating their <em>hearts</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 16-9-2008(93): <strong>Benevolence</strong>: <em>going</em> to help those who are unable to <em>listen</em> (i.e. have no ears). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marydj">marydj</a>] 21-10-2007(40): Darth Vader was put in charge of the<strong> benevolence</strong> fund. He stands holding a bucket with a big heart on it as the column of soilders passes by. Everyone contributes. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(27): A <em>heart</em> which was full of<strong> benevolence</strong>, but so small that it could pass through the <em>eye of a needle</em>, was displayed atop a huge Corinthian <em>column</em> (maybe the relic of some Saint). The <em>column</em> which acted as a stand, reminded viewers not to be fooled by the <em>heart</em>&#039;s <em>needle-eye</em> size. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kunzen">kunzen</a>] 16-1-2010(18): For<strong> benevolence</strong>, I think of the fable in which the mouse pulls the needle out of the lion&#039;s paw. Change the story to make it more graphic. The lion has a NEEDLE in his EYE. The mouse runs down the COLUMN and pulls the NEEDLE out of the lion&#039;s EYE, winning his HEART. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samchan">Samchan</a>] 9-2-2009(11): <em>Go</em> and make the promise (stick a needle in my eye, cross my heart and hope to die), and you shall receive<strong> benevolence</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/robertmyers">robertmyers</a>] 18-5-2009(10): <em>Flash</em> meets the <strong>benevolent</strong> dictator. A <em>ten eyed</em> monster with a big <em>heart</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 3-8-2008(10): More than<strong> benevolence</strong>, this kanji means virtue: &quot;  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/徳">徳</a>   【とく】 (n) virtue&quot; Story: &quot;one virtue is to LISTEN to who your speaking to, not automatically GO against them and try to prove your own point.&quot;. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 15-2-2012(6): <strong>Benevolence</strong> means ones motives can <em>go</em> through the <em>eye of a needle</em> and to the bottom of the <em>heart</em>.
