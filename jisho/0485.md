## Heisig story:

The key word refers to kanji that are written in full, squared form, as opposed to cursive writing which is more flowing andabbreviates some of the strokes. Here <b>block letters</b> are pictured as tidy rows of <i>trees</i> that are <i>all</i> the same size and can be read easily by <i>all</i>, whatever calligraphic skills they possess.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 5-7-2010(25): <strong>Print-style writing</strong> (as opposed to cursive): <em>All</em> <strong>print-style writing</strong> looks rather <em>wooden</em> to me. I prefer the fancy curves of cursive. (Note: Heisig gives this character the official keyword &quot;block letters,&quot; but based on what I&#039;ve read about the meaning of the character in the Yahoo! Japan Dictionary, I prefer &quot;print-style writing&quot;).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Magnus13">Magnus13</a>] 10-7-2011(15): <strong>Block letters</strong> (as opposed to cursive) are rigid and lifeless like <em>wood</em>; they&#039;re <em>all</em> the same size so that <em>all</em> can read them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enoonyllaer">enoonyllaer</a>] 21-8-2010(15): <em>all</em> the hiragana are in &quot;block letters&quot; on <em>wooden</em> blocks, like children&#039;s toys.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 14-1-2011(4): Literally the <strong>block letters</strong> on children&#039;s blocks, carved into <em>wood</em> so clearly that <em>all</em> can read them.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 24-1-2012(3): At the base of the tree, in white<strong> block letters</strong> is written the following; &quot;In 1911, 3 men sat here and compared the whiteness of their skins. In the end it was determined that they were all white.&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-11-2011(3): 楷書 , <a href="../v4/3011">block letters</a> (#3011 楷) カイ ... Parts: 木 , 皆 (cf 行書 <a href="../v4/873">going</a> (#873 行)) ... Story: To make 皆 &#039;s handwriting the same they invented printing. Historically Japan may have had the first metal plate printing ( 百万塔陀羅尼 ), but say it was <em>Wood</em> for the sake of this kanji. Thus, <strong>Block Letters</strong> carved from <em>Trees</em>, to make <em>皆</em>&#039;s writing the same. Worth pointing out that outside Japan, this is called <strong>Kaishu</strong> writing not <strong>Kaisho</strong>. (Kaishu would be a better keyword anyway.).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp">aaroncp</a>] 19-2-2011(3): <em>Everyone</em> owned those<strong> block letters</strong> made out of <em>wood</em> as a child. Note: everyone is a better choice for the meaning of the right kanji.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx">Proxx</a>] 23-7-2010(3): Mysterious <strong>block letters</strong>, carved into <em>all</em> the <em>trees</em> in Japan! <em>All</em> of them! But I don&#039;t understand. It says: 楷楷楷 .

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiwiburner">kiwiburner</a>] 4-7-2012(2): <strong>Block letters</strong> are stamped from <em>wood</em> so that <em>all</em> can understand them.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/subculture">subculture</a>] 12-2-2013(1): In trees all lovers write their names in<strong> block letters</strong>.
