2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 16-3-2007(107): To be<strong> tenacious</strong>, you need to have deep stores of happiness (so troubles don&#039;t discourage you) and you need to be big and round (so hunger doesn&#039;t drive you to give up). The most<strong> tenacious</strong> person of all time was happy round Buddha!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 9-4-2008(5): &quot;The fight itself towards the summits suffices to fill a heart of man; it is necessary to imagine Sisyphus happy.&quot; very famous quote of Camus . Sisyphe is the epitome of the<strong> tenacious</strong> men :for all eternity, he would have to push a rock up a mountain; on the top, the rock rolls down again and Sisyphus has to start over. This ROUND rock which makes him runs in circles doesn&#039;t prevent Sysiphe being HAPPY : he&#039;s too<strong> tenacious</strong> to relinquish. N.B: round as a primitive for Sysiphe (avoid confusion with plump).
