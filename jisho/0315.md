3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dakoina">Dakoina</a>] 8-1-2009(20): When you&#039;re saying a<strong> whale</strong> is just a <em>fish</em>, you&#039;re making a <em>capital</em> mistake!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 3-12-2007(11): Remember when a<strong> whale</strong> swam up the Thames. Everyone thought there was a big <em>fish</em> in the <em>capital</em>, but it was really a<strong> whale</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 9-5-2008(9): Just like the biggest dreadnoughts are called &quot;capital ships&quot;, the<strong> whale</strong> is definitely a &quot;<em>capital fish</em>&quot; !!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 29-9-2008(8): He who thinks that<strong> whale</strong>s are <em>fish</em> makes a <em>capital</em> error - they are mammals!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mickymay">mickymay</a>] 1-5-2011(5): The Fish Capital is called<strong> Whale</strong>s. (In this way it easy to remember the order FISH + CAPITAL =<strong> WHALE</strong>).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Po0py">Po0py</a>] 13-1-2010(5): <strong>Whale</strong>s are caught and broaght to the <em>fish</em> <em>capital</em> of the world.
