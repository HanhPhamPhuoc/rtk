heisig: "<i>Mist</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>dry</i>. The meaning of this key word extends beyond <b>tree trunks</b> to represent the main stem or line of anything from railway lines to managerial staffs. This should help distinguish it from the stories used earlier for <i>book</i> (Frame 224) and <i>body</i> (Frame 1030), both of which made use of the image of a <b>tree trunk</b>, as well as the kanji for <i>trunk</i> (Frame 194)."
