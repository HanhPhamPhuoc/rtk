heisig: "To the many definitions for <b>politics</b> that already exist, this character offers yet another: <i>correct taskmastering</i>. Think about what the primitives tell us. On the one hand, we see the pessimistic wisdom that <b>politics</b> has to do with <i>taskmastering</i>, maneuvering people with or without their will. And on the other, we see the campaign assurances that this duty can be performed <i>correctly</i> if only the right candidate is given a chance."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cosby">cosby</a>] 16-7-2008(189): Insane political <em>correctness</em> on the left, and facists <em>taskmasters</em> on the right- thats<strong> politics</strong> in a nutshell right there.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtstutz">dtstutz</a>] 5-5-2008(23): The Left is careful to be politically correct in speech. The Right whips people into a frenzy of outrage!

But let us not forget <strong>policital</strong> <em>correct</em>ness.

Mnemonic: <em>corrected</em> by the <em>taskmaster</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richizy">richizy</a>] 20-4-2012(4): <strong>Politics</strong> really boils down to electing the <em>correct taskmaster</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer">mdspencer</a>] 25-6-2010(4): The <em>correct</em> <em>taskmaster</em> rarely enters<strong> politics</strong>.
