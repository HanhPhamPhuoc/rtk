heisig: "You may keep the whole range of connotations for this keyword, <b>car</b>, provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them."

## Heisig story:

You may keep the whole range of connotations for this keyword, <b>car</b>, provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Twentytw0">Twentytw0</a>] 19-7-2007(151): My<strong> car</strong> is so fast it can go through ten rice fields in ten minutes.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich">saranich</a>] 20-1-2006(17): Actually, this is a 10x10<strong> car</strong> that can get you through a rice field.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 23-12-2007(15): Rather than hobbling along with a <em>walking stick</em> to cross through a <em>span</em>, it&#039;s much better to use a<strong> car</strong>. (Imagine an old man with a <em>walking stick</em> creeping along a <em>span</em> of road, and you, in a<strong> car</strong>, whizzing right by him. It&#039;s funny &#039;cause it&#039;s true.) Also, it&#039;s important to include the word &quot;through,&quot; so you know the <em>walking stick</em> goes right THROUGH the <em>span</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hotsw4p">hotsw4p</a>] 21-12-2009(12): The travelling <em>time span</em> is <em>cut in half</em> if going by<strong> car</strong>. / The<strong> car</strong> allows you to <em>cut your travelling time span by half</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nycity">nycity</a>] 2-5-2007(8): My<strong> car</strong> cost me the equivalent of 10 rice fields .. 10!!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tleguijt">tleguijt</a>] 28-8-2008(7): This one is quite simple, it looks like a<strong> car</strong> from above, with the frame, axis and big big wheels.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/seminotti">seminotti</a>] 28-5-2009(4): First there is a <em>span</em>, which is the distance between where you are and where you want to go. Then you just cross it straight , going from one end to the other driving your<strong> car</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 6-8-2011(3): Just remember it.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 5-2-2008(3): Our life (and commute) <em>spans</em> have been cut in half since we switched from <em>walking sticks</em> to<strong> CAR</strong>s. (Abbreviation and tweak of dukelexon&#039;s idea; thanks!).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kayin">Kayin</a>] 18-2-2013(2): The <strong>CAR</strong> allows you to cut your travelling time <strong>span</strong> <em>by half</em>. Much faster than if I were to only use my <strong>walking stick</strong>!
