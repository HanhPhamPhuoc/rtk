## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 3-2-2007(32): He had a curious form of<strong> measles</strong> : the red marks on his skin were all in the <em>shape</em> of an <em>umbrella</em>. The doctors of course couldn&#039;t explain it...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 6-8-2009(5): I&#039;m<em> sick</em> with the<strong> measles</strong>. Whenever I go out, I carry my<em> parasol</em> to try and cover up the rash.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 19-8-2010(2): A: &quot;Hey, its a fine day today, why are you hiding under that <em>parasol</em>?&quot; B: &quot;Don&#039;t come near me! I&#039;m <em>sick</em> with the<strong> measles</strong>. It spreads with <em>parasol</em> transmission!&quot; A: &quot;Are you sure it wasn&#039;t &#039;aerosol&#039;?&quot; B: &quot;...&quot; (cough).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 17-2-2010(2): While <em>Bruce Lee</em> was nervously waiting for his <a href="../1724">check-up</a> (#1724 診) at the doctor&#039;s surgery, the <em>caveman</em>, who was suffering from the<strong> measles</strong>, coughed all over <em>Bruce</em>. He tried to prevent the infectious microdroplets from reaching him by opening his <em>umbrella</em> against the spray with lightning-fast reflexes. Unfortunately though, despite his quick response, <em>Bruce</em> inhaled some droplets accidentally, and knowing his fate, sat down next to the <em>caveman</em> for quick treatment.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(2): After his <a href="../1724">check-up</a> (#1724 診), the monk was told he had the<strong> measles</strong>, probably from his measly attire given the weather conditions.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 24-1-2012(1): <em>Mystique</em>, having just stolen the <a href="../1723">rare</a> (#1723 珍) <em>umbrella</em> from the king (who she ditched a while ago) stumbles into a <em>cave</em> while looking for a place to lay low, and accidentally stumbles over the <em>caveman</em>, who is laying sick in bed with the <strong>measles</strong>. Did I mention she never got them as a kid? Must be karma.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amenohi3">amenohi3</a>] 26-7-2012(): After the geisha&#039;s <a href="../1724">check-up</a> (#1724 診) [+libsrone], a <em>caveman</em> saw the geisha&#039;s <em>parasol</em>, and got one himself. When the <em>caveman</em> got <em>sick</em> with <strong>measles</strong> he ripped some off and decorated the <em>parasol</em> in pokadots with them.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 10-5-2011(): <strong>Measles</strong> is a <em>sickness</em> that made people avoid <em>visit</em>s.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 22-5-2010(): (NB: I use <em>HAIRDO</em> for 㐱. Al Sharpton&#039;s, to be more precise.) When Al Sharpton gets the<strong> MEASLES</strong>, fear of the <em>SICKNESS</em> makes him <em>persona non grata</em> at every hair salon he visits. Finally, in a forgotten corner of the city he finds one where the hairdresser also has the same <em>SICKNESS</em>, and he can finally get his trademark <em>HAIRDO</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 20-4-2010(): This is a special breed of<strong> measles</strong> created in a lab to counter the effects of T-virus. Instead of turning you into a zombie, the only symptoms are<strong> measles</strong> in the <em>shape</em> of the <em>Umbrella Corporation</em> logo. The <em>disease</em> was of course designed by covert organisations opposing <em>Umbrella</em>.
