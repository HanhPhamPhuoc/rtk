## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 23-6-2006(148): The word ‘sutra’ literally means a rope or thread that holds things together. Here we see that it is a <em>spool</em> that is holding the <em>threads</em> together.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-2-2008(105): Suggestion: Replace &quot;spool&quot; with &quot;toilet paper/roll&quot;. Reasons: (1) <em>Toilet paper/roll</em> usually comes on a <em>spool</em>. (2) <em>Toilet paper</em> is used to clean the <em>soil</em> off your <em>crotch</em>. Story: <em>Spiderman</em> (= thread) has a roll of <em>toilet paper</em> with the words of a<strong> sutra</strong> printed on each sheet (picture <em>Spiderman</em> saying the<strong> sutra</strong> as he tears sheets off the <em>toilet roll</em>). Spool also appears in <a href="../715">stalk</a> (#715 茎), <a href="../716">suspicious</a> (#716 怪), <a href="../717">lightly</a> (#717 軽), <a href="../882">diameter</a> (#882 径).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 10-11-2007(96): <em>Spiderman</em> is intriqued by some of the positions of the karma<strong> sutra</strong>, but reluctant to take part in an<strong> sutra</strong> orgy as he&#039;d have to reveal his <em>soiled underwear</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 18-1-2008(19): A<strong> sutra</strong> reads: time <strong>flows</strong> as a <em>thread</em> constantly <strong>flowing</strong> out of a <em>spool</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 8-1-2010(18): <em>Spider-Man&#039;s</em> kama<strong> sutra</strong> technique is so crazy that he always needs a whole roll of <em>toilet paper</em> to clean up afterward. Mary Jane is always soaked in a sticky white substance, and it isn&#039;t Spidey&#039;s webs.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 25-4-2007(18): In the Kama<strong> Sutra</strong>, you&#039;ll see a lot of people wearing not a single <em>thread</em>, and <em>spooling</em> around each other in the strangest positions.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 12-8-2009(13): Note: this kanji shows up a lot in <strong>economics</strong>-related words. In fact, 経済 (けいざい) is <strong>economics</strong>. I see it there a lot more than<strong> sutra</strong>-related words... Story: <em>Spools</em> of <em>thread</em> used to drive the <strong>economics</strong> of the day. Imagine an oxymoronic Buddhist<strong> sutra</strong> used to guide you through the world of <em>thread</em> finance.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 17-1-2008(13): The Sanskrit word &quot;<strong>sutra</strong>&quot; literally means <em>thread</em>. Imagine a Buddhist monk keeping all his <em>sutras</em> on a handy <em>spool</em> so he can take them out and use them anywhere.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 21-8-2011(11): The basic thread of the kama<strong> sutra</strong> is all about ways to get your crotch dirty.... 経済 けいざい (n,vs) economics; business; finance; economy... 経常 けいじょう (adj-no) ordinary,,... 日経 にっけい (n) Nikkei (newspaper, share index),....

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 17-9-2009(11): <em>Spiderman</em> attempts a position he sees in the Karma<strong> Sutra</strong>, puts his legs behind his head and accidentally <em>soils his underwear</em>.
