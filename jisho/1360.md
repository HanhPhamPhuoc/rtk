Maestro . . . needle.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 7-11-2008(70): The <em>maestro</em> lives on top of a<strong> large hill</strong> so that he can play music at over <em>ten</em> decibels without anyone giving a damn.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 13-7-2010(19): <strong>Note to those who have not got this far in the book:</strong> This is the full kanji for the <em>Pinnacle</em> primitive (i.e. only the left-hand version of the primitive). The full kanji for the <em>City Walls</em> primitive is <a href="../v4/2180">city walls</a> (#2180 邑). <em>Beyonce</em> went for an invigorating walk up a<strong> large hill</strong> on a summer&#039;s afternoon. Since the grass was so lush and cool, she took off her sandals and immediately stepped on a used hypodermic <em>needle</em>. 岐 <strong>阜</strong>県　ぎ<strong>ふ</strong>けん Gi<strong>fu</strong> Prefecture.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 7-6-2009(11): <em>James Bond</em> is planning a surprise attack on the enemy. He&#039;s sitting on top of a hill, overlooking where he expects the enemy to go by. He checks the <em>hand of his watch (the needle)</em>, noting that there are <em>ten</em> seconds left before the enemy arrives.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 11-4-2011(3): Ludwig van Beethoven, the famous and famously irascible <em>maestro</em>, moves to the <strong>largest hill</strong> he can find in Vienna. At <em>10^10</em> feet above sea level (a ridiculously impossible height), he can compose his <em>tenth</em> symphony in peace. Unfortunately, death takes him before he completes it. Do not confuse with <a href="../v4/1039">hillock</a> (#1039 塚) or <a href="../v4/1329">hill</a> (#1329 丘).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abdwef">abdwef</a>] 8-2-2009(2): James Bond carefully balanced the<strong> large hill</strong> on top of the needle.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 25-1-2012(1): 10 maestros all got on top of each other at the Cirque du Soleil and made a<strong> large hill</strong> of maestros.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/barbouraj">barbouraj</a>] 5-1-2012(1): The <em>maestro</em> actually founded the Pinnacle. He got so popular that he had to stand atop<strong> large hill</strong>s to accommodate the largest audience; they resembled <em>needles</em> below him. Once he made enough money, drawing on the vertiginous inspiration of his performance locale, he retired and established the Pinnacle. But not yet! No pinnacles here!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 26-8-2011(1): 岐阜県 , 陰阜 , 阜陽 =阜阳=Fuyang, <a href="../v4/2928">large hill</a> (#2928 阜) フ ... Parts: Maestro, 十 ...Or 埠頭 <a href="../v4/2189">wharf</a> (#2189 埠) - 土 ... Note: Inane Keyword. This is only used in the Kanji for <strong>Gifu Prefecture</strong>: 岐阜県 . ... Story: Repeat from post for 岐阜 <a href="../v4/772">branch off</a> (#772 岐). (<a href="http://bit.ly/9foFE7">http://bit.ly/9foFE7</a> . All roads lead to Rome, but in Japanese history &quot;control Gifu and you control Japan.&quot; Since controlling Gifu was so key, the <em>10 Maestros</em> that controlled it built a<strong> Large hill</strong> all around <strong>Gifu</strong>. (I got a <strong>B+</strong> for this story, BTW.).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 13-4-2010(1): The &quot;<strong>LARGE HILL</strong>&quot; was the <em>MAESTRO</em>&#039;s affectionate nickname for his favorite symphony, Mahler&#039;s massive <em>TEN</em>th. &quot;To perform it is a long slog, for sure, but whenever I reach it&#039;s summit, I feel great!&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 11-8-2009(1): The <em>maestro</em> beat you in a race up the<strong> large hill</strong>, because he had a <em>needle</em> stuck in his butt.
