## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 16-3-2007(254): The people I had invited to the party were mingling quite well with one another, until they all suddenly started talking about the cars they own. Pretty soon the crowd divided itself into distinct,<strong> contrast</strong>ing crowds: rich snobs with fancy cars, soccer moms with minivans, and hippies with bicycles. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 1-6-2006(67): Our world of today, <em>cars</em> <em>mingling</em> on busy streets, is in stark<strong> contrast</strong> to the one of yesteryear, where it was people who would <em>mingle</em> on the streets. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-2-2008(40): So Darth Vader tried to mingle with the earthlings, wearing his top hat. People were willing to forget his suit, but the Deathstar parked next to the other cars. Its a big<strong> contrast</strong> you know. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 26-10-2008(28): People <em>mingle</em> at parties. In<strong> contrast</strong>, <em>cars mingle</em> in traffic jams. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 15-6-2008(20): All the CARS MINGLING at the intersection (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/交差点">交差点</a>  ）contrast sharply with each other - expensive porches next to old bombs, red next to green, huge SUVs towering over little Minis.... 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 7-2-2010(8): When <em>cars</em> from Japan and America <em>mingle</em> at a party, there is quite a<strong> contrast</strong> between the huge Hummers and little Hondas. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 1-7-2010(6): Transformers are robots that really stand out (ie<strong> contrast</strong>), so they turn into <em>cars</em> to <em>mingle</em> in. Imagine the<strong> contrast</strong> between the massive robot and car forms. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/maggierah">maggierah</a>] 5-1-2010(5): The police were mingling with the bystanders near the scene of a car accident... trying to sort through all the<strong> contrast</strong>ing stories. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 14-2-2013(4): The new Ford<strong> Contrast</strong> is such a wonderful <em>car</em>, it&#039;s like a Ferrari <em>mingled</em> with a Rolls Royce. Aptly named too as it&#039;s a stark<strong> contrast</strong> from previous models. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mary_K">Mary_K</a>] 19-6-2009(4): <em>Cars</em> that <em>mingled</em> were of <em>contrasting</em> colors.
