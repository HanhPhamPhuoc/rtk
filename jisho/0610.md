## Heisig story:

With a bit of stretching, you might see a horse's head pointing leftwards in this character. That gives the primary meaning of the Chinese zodiacal sign of the horse, which corresponds to the hour of <b>noon</b>. Note how this kanji primitive differs from that for <i>cow</i> (Frame 260).
