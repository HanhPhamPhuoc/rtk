## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 9-5-2007(270): I&#039;m a lazy fisher, so I genetically engineered a <em>lily pad</em> with a <em>fishing hook at the stem</em> and a <em>mouth</em> to<strong> call</strong> me whenever it catches something.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(69): I just follow the <strong>calls</strong> from the frogs <em>mouths</em> on the <em>lily pads</em> to <em>hook</em> them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woodwojr">woodwojr</a>] 15-7-2008(62): The right portion of this character isn&#039;t a water lily at all; we will take it to be a <em>broken hand</em> (see how if you rotate the second and third strokes, you approach the appearance of the character for hand?). In this character, we see someone who is trapped with a <em>broken hand</em> opening their <em>mouth</em> to<strong> call</strong> for help.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 25-7-2008(29): Inspired by dingomick: &#039;Budd&#039; - &#039;weis&#039; - &#039;er&#039;<strong> call</strong> the frogs <em>mouths</em> from the <em>liliy pads</em>, working to get you <em>hooked</em> on beer. <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f3mXaATLeRM">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f3mXaATLeRM</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 17-3-2008(17): Not really <em>even</em> and first and last strokes are a different stroke type. Frog with open <em>mouth</em><strong> call</strong>ing out as he slips off the <em>water-lily, bending it out of shape</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Saeko_chan">Saeko_chan</a>] 10-11-2011(9): I <em>say</em> we <strong>call</strong> it <em>even</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 11-4-2010(9): (NB: The RHS, 乎, is a kanji in its own right, meaning <em>QUESTION MARK</em>. [thx hereticalrants] Think of a <em>DISTORTED LILY</em>, bent over, by the weight of its heavy flower, into the shape of a <em>QUESTION MARK</em>.) All the<strong> CALL</strong>s I get these days are phone polls. These poor devils have to ask so many questions every day that their <em>MOUTH</em>s take on the shape of <em>QUESTION MARK</em>s!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vengeorgeb">vengeorgeb</a>] 25-4-2009(6): Imagine the frogs on the <em>lily pads</em> singing: I just<strong> call</strong>, to say I love you! I just<strong> call</strong> to say how much I care...&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 2-9-2006(5): Since the right side of the kanji differs from <a href="../1484">even</a> (#1484 平) in several ways (the barb on the bottom and the shape of the top stroke), I break it up differently as we hear the detective say, &quot;After just one <em>little drop</em> entered his <em>mouth</em>, the victim<strong> call</strong>ed out &#039;My drink has been <em>spiked</em>!&#039; and fell over dead.&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 21-1-2008(4): The poor fish - <em>even with a hook</em> in his <em>mouth</em> he can&#039;t<strong> call</strong> out.
