## Heisig story:

In place of the <i>drop</i> at the start of the character for <i>family name</i>, we have a <i>mouth</i>, which makes you think of the &quot;vox populi.&quot;

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/burento5">burento5</a>] 22-6-2008(150): How many of you know what &quot;vox populi&quot; means?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-3-2007(139): All the <strong>people</strong> of the world with all their <em>family names</em> shouting with their big <em>mouths</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 22-1-2008(49): Once they&#039;d learned to properly utilize their <em>mouths</em> to form a language, the<strong> people</strong> of the world all adopted <em>family names</em>, regardless of their race, culture etc..

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 8-7-2007(35): [people; nation; subjects] Somehow I remember this kanji as the <strong><em>P</em>eople</strong>&#039;s <em>R</em>epublic of <em>One</em> family name. It resembles an <em>R</em> with <em>one</em> striking it through.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narazumono">narazumono</a>] 17-1-2009(31): In a government of the<strong> people</strong>, by the<strong> people</strong>, and for the<strong> people</strong> one&#039;s <em>mouth</em> is more important than your <em>family name</em>. 民主主義 - (みんしゅしゅぎ Democracy).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/unauthorized">unauthorized</a>] 3-1-2010(29): Note: <em>Vox populi</em> means &quot;voice of the<strong> people</strong>&quot; referring to<strong> people</strong> as nation. This is often used as an abbreviation of the phrase &quot;<em>Vox populi, vox dei</em>&quot; which means &quot;voice of the<strong> people</strong>, voice of god&quot;, referring to the godlike power<strong> people</strong> have over their government. In this context, I think of this character as an angry mob that is rebelling against it&#039;s corrupt government (hence we have big <em>mouths</em> which call out the unwanted officials by their <em>family name</em>).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/danschub">danschub</a>] 4-11-2011(15): Because of the stroke order, this looks more like a <em>flag</em> than a mouth to me. So when a national flag begins to replace the <em>family name</em>/clan, a<strong> people</strong> becomes a nation.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asayoru">Asayoru</a>] 7-11-2010(15): <strong>People</strong> are generally born with a big, screaming <em>mouth</em> and a <em>family name</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miku555">miku555</a>] 16-1-2010(7): The first thing that comes from<strong> PEOPLE</strong>&#039;s Mouths after you meet them is their Family Name.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-12-2005(7): Mnemonic trick to avoid the generic word : &quot;boat-people&quot;. Someone is checking<strong> people</strong> who are desperate to get on board, and tries to quiet<strong> people</strong> and get things back in order : &quot;I am going to call the <em>family names</em>, if someone opens their <em>mouth</em> when it is not their <em>family name</em>, they won&#039;t get on board !&quot;.
