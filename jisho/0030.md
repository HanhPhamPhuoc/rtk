heisig: "While we normally refer to the start of the day as &quot;daybreak,&quot; Japanese commonly refers to it as the &quot;opening up of night&quot; into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, <b>nightbreak</b>. The single stroke at the bottom represents the <i>floor</i> (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the <i>sun</i> is poking its head"
