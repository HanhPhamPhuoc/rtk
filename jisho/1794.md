## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 13-5-2008(145): Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig<strong> me</strong>thod, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it&#039;s the kanji for &quot;boku.&quot; Males usually use either &quot;boku&quot; or &quot;ore&quot; (instead of &quot;watashi&quot;) to refer themselves. &quot;Boku&quot; is slightly boyish and soft; &quot;ore&quot; is rough &amp; tough. Mr. T would definitely use &quot;ore&quot; -- but when he&#039;s one of the husbands hung upside down in a row about to be punished by his wife, he puts on a sweet act and switches to &quot;boku&quot; when he pleads &quot;come on baby, it&#039;s<strong> ME</strong>!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 21-5-2006(112): Mr. T also finds himself as one of the HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 25-10-2012(3): You can identify <em>Khatzumoto</em> from the <em>row of upside-down husbands</em> because he&#039;s the only one that says <strong>boku</strong> when poked, all of the others learned from a textbook and say watashi.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snzzbk">snzzbk</a>] 15-2-2009(3): [Revision of story from <a href="../1793">slap</a> (#1793 撲)]: The napping woman crawls out from under the <em>upturned rowboat</em> and sees <em>Mr. T</em> first, so she slaps him. <em>Mr. T</em> says &quot;It wasn&#039;t<strong> me</strong>, fool!&quot; and points at <em>Homer</em>.
