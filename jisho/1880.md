heisig: "Though it's a good thing that the primitive for <b>cocoon</b> has been radically abbreviated from this, its full form as a kanji, the story it holds is a charming one. The silkworm (<i>insect</i>) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the <i>flowers</i>), digests them and transforms them into <i>thread</i> with which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the <i>hood</i>). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 27-7-2008(190): This is a simple two-column manga showing the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a<strong> cocoon</strong>. First, the caterpillar gets under a large flower (bees tend to hang around flowers, which scare away other predators). Then, in the first frame, we see the caterpillar (<em>insect</em>). Then, a bar separating this frame from the next frame (remember that Japanese manga run the other way!), in which we see the <em>insect</em> covered with <em>thread</em>, making a beautiful<strong> cocoon</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd">eightyd</a>] 15-8-2009(172): I dont like lesson 51 so far.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gdaxeman">gdaxeman</a>] 14-1-2008(82): The magic <em>flower</em> is the reason why <em>Spider-Man</em> ended up miniaturized and confined inside a <em>hood</em>-like <strong>cocoon</strong> together with an <em>insect</em>. Now, only a <em>walking stick</em> separates them both.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alucard">Alucard</a>] 19-1-2007(45): See book, one of the good stories you can remember from there.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 20-11-2009(31): <em>Spider-Man</em> bent over to pick up a pretty <em>flower</em> when a giant <em>glass hood</em> dropped over him- it&#039;s a trap! Now he&#039;s stuck inside, fending off a swarm <em>insect</em> with his <em>walking stick</em> as they try to wrap him in a<strong> cocoon</strong>. Could this be the end of <em>Spider-Man</em>?!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 4-10-2009(12): This is a (western) comic representation of the forming process of a<strong> cocoon</strong>. Under a big protective <em>flower</em> the caterpillar spins it&#039;s <em>thread</em> and forms the<strong> cocoon</strong>, in the next frame it emerges as an <em>insect</em>, the butterfly. (+thanks dihutenosa, just tried to fix the writing order a bit).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong">samesong</a>] 20-1-2009(5): Spiderman and a giant insect are separated by a pane of glass inside of a glass canopy; if spiderman doesn&#039;t manage to get outside and steal the flower on top of the canopy, the bug is going to break through the glass and turn him into a giant<strong> cocoon</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 27-6-2009(4): The<strong> cocoon</strong>was placed in a GRASS, doubleHOOD made from the THREADs of an INSECT.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Phlail">Phlail</a>] 15-9-2012(2): The silkworm (<em>insect</em>) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the <em>flowers</em>), digests them and transforms them into <em>thread</em> which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the <em>hood</em>). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception. (Taken from RTK1 - J. W. Heisig).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-10-2008(2): To recharge, <em>Spider-Man</em> makes a <em>hood</em> of web around himself with a separate compartment for his favorite <em>insect</em>, forming a<strong> cocoon</strong> from which he will <em>flower</em> anew.
