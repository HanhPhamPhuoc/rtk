heisig: "Though it's a good thing that the primitive for <b>cocoon</b> has been radically abbreviated from this, its full form as a kanji, the story it holds is a charming one. The silkworm (<i>insect</i>) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the <i>flowers</i>), digests them and transforms them into <i>thread</i> with which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the <i>hood</i>). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception."
