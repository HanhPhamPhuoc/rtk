## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-9-2007(147): A <strong>column</strong> of text scratched on a black tree beside the <em>gates of Hell</em>: To the <em>East</em> lies The Beast. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 28-5-2007(135): [column; handrail; blank; space] I think about <em>oriental</em> (<em>eastern</em>) Torii <em>gates</em>: they have two supporting <strong>column</strong>s made of <em>wood</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 14-4-2008(107): Ancient morning newspaper<strong> column</strong>, posted daily on a <strong>tree</strong> at the <strong>east gate</strong>. Why the <strong>east gate</strong>? Well, it&#039;s a morning paper, and the sun rises in the east, so the morning rays shining through the gate illuminate it nicely. I picture all the ojisan who rise in the wee hours gathering around the tree each, waiting for the sun rise so they can read the paper. &quot;Been coming here every day for 40 years! Can&#039;t start the day without my paper!&quot;. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 20-8-2006(25): <em>Bill Gates</em> already dominates the software industry in the West, and now he is turning his attention to the <em>East</em>. Trying to gain popularity and a glentler image there he writes a <em>column</em> in newspapers there about how he plans to save the <em>trees</em> using the latest and greatest features of Windows Vista. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 10-3-2008(20): This is a <strong>column of text</strong>, as used in a newspaper. The trick for this kanji is that to mark the <strong>columns</strong> in the old printers, you place <em>wooden</em> blocks at certain intervals of the paper. Now, look at the right part; it looks as if you had put a <em>wooden</em> block in an <em>interval</em> primitive. That graphical reminder will help you to remember this kanji!! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dustin_Calgary">Dustin_Calgary</a>] 14-1-2009(15): There is a<strong> COLUMN</strong> of TREES next to the EAST GATES. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 27-12-2006(12): The right side is its own kanji, 闌(たけなわ). Also used in 闌(た)ける. It means &quot;to peak&quot; or &quot;to excel&quot; and is almost too rare to bother with at all. It will appear again in   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/蘭">蘭</a>  , which is not so rare. It overlaps with &quot;pinnacle&quot;, but I don&#039;t mind. Apparently, the art of saloon keeping reached its peak in the East, just like everything else seems to in the wacky world of kanjis (see e.g.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/陳">陳</a>   and   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/練">練</a>  ). Trees (dead ones) excel in having<strong> column</strong>s written on them. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-9-2008(7): I was trying to tell some <em>Eastern lesbians</em> about my weekly newspaper<strong> column</strong> about Japan, but they thought I meant my <em>wood</em><strong> column</strong>, and told me I was barking up the wrong <em>tree</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 16-2-2008(4): Dingomick&#039;s story is good because this kanji means &quot;column of text&quot; such as a news paper article; not a<strong> column</strong> of tree&#039;s, pillars, etc. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Norman">Norman</a>] 13-2-2013(3): A<strong> COLUMN</strong> of decorative GATES made of WOOD are common in the Far EAST.
