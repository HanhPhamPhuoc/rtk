heisig: The type of <i>boat</i> connoted by this key word is a large oceangoing <b>liner</b>. The important thing here is to work with the elements <i>boat</i> and <i>dove</i> to make an image distinct from that of the former frame. Don't count on size alone to distinguish the <i>boat</i> from the <b>liner</b>.
