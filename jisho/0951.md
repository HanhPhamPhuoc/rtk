## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(156): Behold Mister T (of &quot;A-Team&quot; fame)! I chose Mr.T because he&#039;s sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he&#039;s both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic”<strong> person</strong>, telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 1-10-2006(44): [I appreciate some people&#039;s occasional habit of using <em>P</em> for <strong>person</strong> in shared stories. That makes it easier to substitute <em>Mr. T</em>, <em>Captain Picard</em>, or whomever else a student is using as <strong>person.</strong>]. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ImaginaryJapan">ImaginaryJapan</a>] 31-12-2009(31): <em>Khatzumoto</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-12-2007(30): For this character, I&#039;m going to use Chuck Norris. He is a world class martial artist, winning several karate championships in a row. He also achieved ultimate power according to his Chuck Norris Facts, and works as a Texas Ranger (sheriff). He is however a very kind and religious<strong> person</strong>. Here we have a view of his powerful legs, while the contracted form shows him performing a roundhouse kick. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/didz13">didz13</a>] 19-8-2008(24): JESUS. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/somukeru">somukeru</a>] 6-3-2008(23): I like to use Jedi for this one. The shape suggests the cloak and as a primitive I can see a standing figure with a light-sabre held down and to the side. The Jedi<strong> person</strong>ification also gives me something specific enough to focus on, while still having scope to use different Jedi in different Kanji (Obi-wan for Hermit, Yoda for Remote etc.). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Schwingy">Schwingy</a>] 1-4-2009(9): As a primitive on the left side, I chose Solid Snake from the series Metal Gear Solid. This worked pretty well with kanji like protect, inn, reliant, tenderness, what, bystander and others as well. I thought of the direction/compass primitive as his radar system, and the taskmaster as the colonel. When the primitive is   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/人">人</a>  , I used Raiden from MGS 2. Why can&#039;t you see him arms? That&#039;s because he is covering his junk while he runs around naked, of course! 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelexvision">thelexvision</a>] 28-1-2010(8): Why not use, &quot;Hito&quot; [ひと] which means<strong> person</strong> ..(and is coincidentally the meaning of this kanji). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tengukun">tengukun</a>] 12-1-2009(8): Onizuka Eikichi, I put him above all badass characters. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meeatcookies">meeatcookies</a>] 12-3-2012(7): The fun starts here! Im using <strong>Cirno/Chiruno ⑨</strong> as the<strong> person</strong>. If you ever had something to do with touhou, it&#039;s easy ride for you from now. Google her if you dont who is she, you may also find it very easy thanks to it. Ive provided at least one(usually more) story for each kanji with the<strong> person</strong> primitive.
