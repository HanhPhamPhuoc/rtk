## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 9-1-2008(190): The <em>taskmistress</em> in a moment of weakness allowed the man&#039;s <em>column</em> to<strong> penetrate</strong> her. As punishment he was made to <em>bring up</em> their infant.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 7-11-2005(122): Ha! In this frame, a bunch of taskmasters are lined up to<strong> penetrate</strong> the kids they raise/bring up! I&#039;m thinking of some priests and choir boys.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 10-1-2008(65): Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to<strong> penetrate</strong> enemy <em>line</em>s (or the <em>columns</em> of soliders). It won&#039;t be easy: the soldiers have been <em>brought up</em> since birth, by the <em>taskmaster</em>, to be on guard. To remember <em>brought up</em>, imagine horrible Orcs being created and <em>brought up</em> through black magic and pledging their allegiance to the evil <em>taskmaster</em>. These aren&#039;t Orc recruits; these are Orcs that have been created through black magic and <em>brought up</em> to destroy the enemy.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 3-9-2007(55): <strong>Penetrate</strong> = &quot;<strong>goes</strong> into.&quot; As in the lessons of the taskmaster penetrating the minds of those he his bringing up.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 24-6-2008(26): Compare the two kanji for &#039;penetrate&#039; and &#039;remove&#039;: here, the child who wasn&#039;t <em>raised / brought up</em> with very good manners is <em>going</em> to give his taskmaster a big <em>kancho</em>. After he is<strong> penetrate</strong>d, his angry parents tell him to <a href="../760">remove</a> (#760 撤) his finger. (Don&#039;t know what a kancho is? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kancho">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kancho</a>).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gilch">gilch</a>] 11-6-2010(15): Note similarity to <a href="../760">remove</a> (#760 撤). They seem kind of like opposites. <strong>Penetrate</strong> just <em>goes</em> all-in, but to <strong>remove</strong> something you need your <em>fingers</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-2-2007(13): <em>The Flash</em> and the <em>taskmaster</em><strong> penetrate</strong> the kids they <em>bring up</em> (from both sides).

I know this story is horrible but remembering the kanji takes priority.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 8-8-2008(9): Columns of manipulative newspaper articles to<strong> penetrate</strong> people&#039;s minds and bring them up to think what the taskmasters of this world want them to.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Koos83">Koos83</a>] 15-11-2009(7): Because the <em>taskmaster</em><strong> penetrate</strong>d so many women, there&#039;s now a <em>line</em> of infants waiting to be <em>brought up</em> by him.
