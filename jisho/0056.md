heisig: "How do we get a <i>mouth</i> over a <i>shellfish</i> to mean an <b>employee</b>? Simple. Just remember the advice new <b>employees</b> get about keeping their <i>mouths</i> shut and doing their job, and then make that more graphic by picturing an office building full of white collar workers scurrying around with <i>clams</i> pinched to their <i>mouths</i>."
