In other words, it is the part which feeds us. Hence -- &quot;the<strong> ear</strong> (of a plant) is the <em>favor</em> of the <em>wheat</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-11-2007(40): Botanist (lecturing to class): &quot;. . . and this is the <strong>ear of the plant</strong>.&quot; <em>Wheat</em> plant: &quot;Will you do me a <em>favor</em> and stop shouting in my<strong> ear</strong>!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 20-10-2009(17): The<strong> ear</strong> of corn fell into the dirt. It shouted to the nearby <em>wheat</em>- &quot;Hey! HEY! Could you do me a <em>favor</em>?!&quot; No answer... stupid stuck up wheat.

One day, the people begged the wheat plant for a favor to make their lives easier. &quot;It&#039;s too difficult to turn wheat into bread,&quot; they said. They wanted a fast-food making plant. Behold! The plant produced an<strong> ear</strong> of corn! Perfect for making popcorn! Much easier than bread! And so,<strong> ear</strong>s of corn are a favor from the wheat plant. That is how corn plants came into existence. This is also why the tassel on top of a corn plant looks kinda like wheat.
