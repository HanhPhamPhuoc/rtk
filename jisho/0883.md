## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 28-5-2007(309): What&#039;s the main difference between a<strong> he</strong> and a she? The<strong> he</strong> has a <em>column</em> covered in a <em>pelt</em>... a penis. Badum-ching.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 8-1-2008(58): The ultimate<strong> he</strong>-man is the Neanderthal cave man. His club is as big as a pillar (<em>column</em>), and<strong> he</strong> wears a ragged <em>pelt</em> as his only clothing. To remember the <em>column</em>, imagine the cave man resting the club vertically like a column when not in use.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 11-8-2009(42): Wherever<strong> he</strong> <em>goes</em> //<strong> he</strong> wears <em>pelt</em> clothes.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 27-8-2008(9): <strong>He</strong> <em>goes</em> on a hunt for <em>pelts</em> regularly. What a macho<strong> he</strong>-man<strong> he</strong> is.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-5-2006(8): <strong>He</strong> has a pelt (&quot;skin of a beast&quot;, the dictionary says!) around his column (&quot;a vertical structure standing alone and not supporting anything&quot;, the dictionary says!). I blame the dictionary.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag">hunchbag</a>] 6-11-2009(4): <strong>He</strong> is <em>going</em> to <em>pelt</em> you!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sprutnik">sprutnik</a>] 22-3-2009(4): In prehistoric times <em>going</em> hunting was very important for getting the latest fashion. Because if <em>he</em> wore a <em>pelt</em> from last year&#039;s collection the girls would have nothing to do with him. Not much have change the last 10.000 years.
