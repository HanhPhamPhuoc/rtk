heisig: "<i>Bound up</i> . . . <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>walking stick</i> . . . <i>two</i>. If you write the character once, you will see why we avoided using the element for <i>soil</i>, which would prompt you to write it in improper order.

## Heisig story:

<i>Bound up</i> . . . <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>walking stick</i> . . . <i>two</i>. If you write the character once, you will see why we avoided using the element for <i>soil</i>, which would prompt you to write it in improper order.

## Premitive:

As a primitive, imagine the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right-angles.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 4-5-2007(203): A museum display of two walking sticks bound together under a glass canopy, showing the first device used to measure an<strong> angle</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-12-2007(36): [+nuke] As a primitive, a boomerang. This boomerang is used to grab a bunch of meat, or <em>flesh</em>, lying around on the ground at a farm. First, you throw it straight at a <em>walking stick</em>, then it makes a right<strong> angle</strong> and goes to <em>walking stick</em> number <em>two</em>, and wraps around that. A quick tug, and you&#039;ve got all the <em>flesh</em> flying toward you contained in that tri<strong>angle</strong>. Hooray for free (stolen) food!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 30-6-2007(27): [angle; corner; square; horn; antlers] I needed to measure an <strong>angle</strong>, so I improvised a rudimentary protractor by <em>bounding up</em> a <em>walking stick</em> to some <em>body part</em> of mine.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-12-2007(16): The<strong> ANGLE</strong> of a Boomerang? BOUND UP, thrown by the BODY, but is not a WALKING STICK thanks to that 90 degree<strong> ANGLE</strong> in each one. So as a primitive, use Boomerang.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo">ezmoreldo</a>] 30-6-2008(8): If you bind up a circle with a rope, tied tightly it will have<strong> angle</strong>s.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 18-6-2008(7): New Primitive: Kurt<strong> Angle</strong>. Get ready for some action, wrestling fans! Haha. &quot;Oh my GOD! Kurt<strong> Angle</strong> has <em>bound up</em> HHH and has a glass canopy over his head so he can&#039;t see a thing! What&#039;s<strong> Angle</strong> doing with that <em>walking stick</em>? He&#039;s beating HHH senseless! He&#039;s going to break him in <em>two</em>! Somebody stop this!&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ddapore99">ddapore99</a>] 1-3-2011(5): He BOUND UP her FLESH and cut small LINE in the middle of her swimsuit. Then he took photos from every<strong> ANGLE</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 6-5-2009(5): If you remove the tip of your <em>screwdriver</em> and add a <em>hook</em> you can use it in <strong>corners</strong> and right-<strong>angle</strong>s. (but mind the different stroke order).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 21-5-2008(4): The<strong> angle</strong> of <em>one circle</em> is <em>bounded</em> by 360 degrees.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 25-3-2008(4): Because this kanji also means <strong>horns</strong>, I use a <strong>Toro</strong> (a spanish bull) as a primitive (you can use also a shogi/chess bishop as a primitive, as they always move in <strong>angles</strong>).
