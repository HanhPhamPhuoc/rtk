heisig: "Under the primitive for <i>house</i> we meet the kanji for <i>span</i>. Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching: &quot;<b>proclaiming</b> the good news to all nations&quot; and &quot;shouting it from the <i>housetops</i>.&quot; That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: advertising."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frychiko">frychiko</a>] 14-2-2008(304): You can<strong> proclaim</strong> your opinions from the comfort of your HOUSE and have it SPAN the entire globe these days via The Internet.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 27-8-2007(59): I heard young Muslims have to memorise the Koran and<strong> proclaim</strong> it aloud as a kind of rite of passage. Imagine the SPAN of hours spent under a ROOF practising that! It must surely be worse than trying to get through Heisigs RTK - count yourself lucky.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 25-10-2007(42): A local official<strong> proclaim</strong>s a curfew <em>spanning</em> sunset to sunrise - you must stay under your own <em>roof</em> during that time <em>span</em>. I keep wanting to add in the &quot;words&quot; 言 primitive. Don&#039;t think about someone reading it aloud - focus on the CURFEW that was<strong> proclaim</strong>ed. I also tend to confuse this one with <a href="../342">imperial edict</a> (#342 詔). Remember this proclamation comes from a petty local official.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher">tstuhldreher</a>] 16-6-2008(36): I keep thinking about the Irish one-hit band the<strong> Proclaim</strong>ers, who promised to walk 500 miles -- quite a long SPAN -- to reach your HOUSE.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama">Ameyama</a>] 26-2-2008(23): <strong>Proclaim</strong> something loud enough that <strong>spans</strong> the <strong>roof</strong> tops.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anroo">anroo</a>] 10-7-2009(16): Parents<strong> proclaim</strong>: &quot;In the <em>span</em> of time you&#039;re under our <em>roof</em> you&#039;ll abide by our rules.&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cyberclops">cyberclops</a>] 28-1-2010(12): I<strong> proclaim</strong> that my <em>house</em> shall <em>span</em> several generations.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta">Dualta</a>] 12-3-2008(11): The new king <strong>PROCLAIMED</strong> that his <strong>HOUSE</strong> (family) would <strong>SPAN</strong> centuries.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 9-10-2007(11): The kanji for span looks to me like one of those old parchment scrolls. Imagine a herald standing on a balcony under the <em>roof</em> of the king&#039;s house reading the scroll and<strong> proclaim</strong>ing to the residents of the kingdom that the king has a son and that everyone should celebrate.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bspitz">bspitz</a>] 22-10-2009(8): A blogger can<strong> proclaim</strong> opinions that <em>span</em> the globe while he sits in the comfort of his own <em>home</em>.
