heisig: Under the primitive for <i>house</i> we meet the kanji for <i>span</i>. Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching: "<b>proclaiming</b> the good news to all nations" and "shouting it from the <i>housetops</i>." That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: advertising.
