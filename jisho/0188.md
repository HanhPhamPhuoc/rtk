heisig: "Under the primitive for <i>house</i> we meet the kanji for <i>span</i>. Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching: &quot;<b>proclaiming</b> the good news to all nations&quot; and &quot;shouting it from the <i>housetops</i>.&quot; That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: advertising."
