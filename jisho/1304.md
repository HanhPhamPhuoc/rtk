3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 6-3-2009(30): The kanji for いっぱい is <a href="midori://search?text=一杯．">一杯．</a> One cup is great, two cups still good, but if you have so many<strong> cupfuls</strong> that you pass out under a <em>tree</em>, the situation has turned <em>negative</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 7-5-2007(20): A wooden cup is a piece of <em>wood</em> with <em>negative</em> space waiting to be filled by the <em>cupfuls</em>.
