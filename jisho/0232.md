heisig: "The <b>splash</b> this kanji refers to is the dash of <i>water</i> against the rocks, with all the foam and spray that this creates. If you think of a <b>splash</b> in this sense as a wave that has run its full course and reached its <i>extremity</i>, namely the seashore, and if you think of it pictorially in your mind's eye, this somewhat rare (but oh so-easy-to-learn) kanji is yours for good."
