1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 8-7-2009(210): マオ Zedong always carried a<strong> halberd</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 1-2-2006(38): Make the<strong> halberd</strong> a heroic warrior (perhaps of scandinavian origin) who weilds this polearm - the most effective, brutal and vicious one - with great skill. He can use it to hook, pierce and chop (the three strokes). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrenaline">adrenaline</a>] 28-5-2009(34): Mao (マオ) gets his head chopped off by a<strong> halberd</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 16-3-2009(19): <strong>Halberd</strong>: A weapon of the 15th and 16th centuries having an axlike <em>blade</em> and a steel <em>spike</em> mounted on the end of a long <em>shaft</em>. <strong>Pictograph:</strong> Take a moment to see its different parts. The upper マ is the <em>blade</em>, the horizontal line belongs to the <em>shaft</em>, and finally the lower vertical line is the <em>spike</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(12): It looks a lot like child. Picture a powerful warrior cutting a child&#039;s head off with a<strong> halberd</strong>. You can see the head removed from the body and the slashing<strong> halberd</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 21-6-2009(7): To me it looks like a pictograph of a person walking carrying a<strong> halberd</strong> over his shoulders. The マ is the head. The third stroke is the<strong> halberd</strong>. The last two strokes are the two legs. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meiko452">meiko452</a>] 16-11-2010(6): Gimli&#039;s<strong> halberd</strong> is named MAO マオ. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 12-12-2007(5): (Per synewave) A <em>Swiss Guardsmen at the Vatican</em>, holding a<strong> halberd</strong>. (tweaking gorgon) He can use the<strong> halberd</strong> to chop, hook and pierce. In order from top to bottom you can see parts of the blade to do each of these, hanging off the vertical stroke which is the handle. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 26-7-2007(4): MA pats her <em>child</em> on the back with a hook for his stroke of <em>genius</em> that helped to create the<strong> Halberd</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/claxton">claxton</a>] 26-7-2008(3): This is a pictograph. Notice the bottom half of this kanji is showing the handle in what looks very close to an ax although it takes a bit of imagination (the vertical line for the &quot;cliff&quot; is moved over a bit). I assume the lines are a bit closer together because this isn&#039;t a wide ax handle but rather a narrower pole. The top part of the kanji represents the action end of the weapon with a little spike sticking out.
