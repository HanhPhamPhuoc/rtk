## Heisig story:

First, do not confuse this character with <i>venerable old man</i> (Frame 849), which is far more rarely used. The character for an <b>old man</b> begins with an abbreviation of the character for <i>somebody</i>, the <i>nose</i> having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the <i>soil</i> drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when &quot;dust to dust&quot; begins to take on a personal meaning; the diagonal <i>walking stick</i> for getting around; and the <i>spoon</i> for being spoon-fed.

## Premitive:

As a primitive, the meaning is the same, but the final two strokes are omitted so that they can be replaced with other elements: fl.

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 18-12-2006(200): An<strong> old man</strong>, wondering what it&#039;s like in a grave, <em>sits</em> in a freshly dug plot. When a gravekeeper mistakes him for dead and begins burying him with <em>soil</em>, the<strong> old man</strong> saves himself by flailing his <em>walking stick</em> in the air.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac">aphasiac</a>] 14-8-2009(71): The <em>dirty</em><strong> old man</strong> had a <em>stroke</em> so now he must be <em>spoon</em> fed.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 18-3-2009(18): An<strong> OLD MAN</strong> in a Japanese nursing home must follow the rules: <em>no</em> <em>spoon</em>ing the nurses or <em>soil</em>ing pants. (The slash is like a katakana &quot;no&quot; : ノ).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nicjsb">nicjsb</a>] 4-10-2008(16): Old men soil themselves, have diagonal walking sticks, and must be spoon fed.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/einahpets">einahpets</a>] 1-2-2012(5): This doesn&#039;t specifically mean an<strong> old man</strong>, so I&#039;m changing the keyword to <strong>old folks</strong> to avoid confusion (ex. 老人ホーム = senior citizens&#039; home). I know it&#039;s not nice to say but these old folks are as old as <em>dirt</em>. They have <em>walking sticks</em> that are bent diagonal from years of use and can only eat pureed food with <em>spoons</em>.
