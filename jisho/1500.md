2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 5-5-2007(68): In front of the COLUMNS of the Capitol, the<strong> HONORABLE</strong> congressmen can be bought WHOLESALE.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 17-1-2008(40): When buying wholesale the<strong> honorable</strong> thing to do would be to wait in line like everyone else.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 31-12-2008(27): Salesman: &quot;I&#039;m <em>going</em> to do the<strong> honorable</strong> thing and sell you this item <em>wholesale</em>.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 30-6-2007(12): <em>The Flash</em>, being an<strong> honorable</strong> person, zoomed around Costco <em>wholesale</em> helping everyone quickly find everything. (They honored him by using 御 (ご) a lot in their speech. <a href="http://google.com/#q=御ゆっくり、御めん">御ゆっくり、御めん</a> etc.).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cosby">cosby</a>] 1-12-2009(9): If a trader has an<strong> honorable</strong> reputation- then people will line up to buy his wholesale goods.

This trick works <em>occasionally</em>, as in ご両親 or ご家族 , but don&#039;t <em>GO WHOLESALE</em> with it, or you&#039;ll come across as a well-meaning<strong> HONORABLE</strong> fool, at best.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 20-6-2009(5): The<strong> honorable</strong> thing to do is to STAND IN LINE and wait your turn when there&#039;s a WHOLESALE special.
