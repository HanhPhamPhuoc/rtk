## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 11-10-2007(322): <em>Flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> over a cooking fire = &quot;hotdog&quot;. There are all <strong>sorts of things</strong> in <em>hot dogs</em>. Believe me, you don&#039;t want to know what <strong>sort of things</strong> . Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji. (tweaked version of ziggr&#039;s. Thanks!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 9-9-2006(98): There are all <strong>sorts of things</strong> in <em>hot dogs</em>. (I use <em>hot dog</em> for this primitive (<em>meat</em> of a <em>dog</em> over a <em>cooking fire</em>). I swear I can actually see the 月 here as a hot dog, with its slight curve and grill marks.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 16-10-2007(39): Putting the <em>flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> on a <em>fire</em> is the<strong> sort of thing</strong> that will get you arrested.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vxnine">vxnine</a>] 21-9-2008(22): Imagine the <em>flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> roasting OVER a fire. Gross. I&#039;d never want to eat that<strong> sort of thing</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sonofswin">Sonofswin</a>] 2-2-2009(18): The <em>moon</em> in the <em>evening</em> is the <strong>sort of thing</strong> that makes a <em>dog</em> howl as if <em>on fire</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 16-10-2011(11): This is not actually <em>flesh</em> (for an example of bendy flesh, see <a href="../v4/489">ambition</a> (#489 望) - save yourself time now because I keep mixing them up), this is actually an <em>evening</em> with an extra <em>drop</em>, which I&#039;m calling <strong>twilight</strong>. So here we have a discussion of all the silly <strong>sorts of things</strong> dogs do. Like that time my <em>chihuahua</em> fell into the <em>fire pit</em> because it couldn&#039;t see due to the <em>twilight</em> :-(.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harhol">harhol</a>] 13-5-2009(10): Snoop DOGG likes nothing more than to chill by an open FLAME under the MOONLIGHT, where he can light an infinite number of spliffs and remain stoned indefinitely. It&#039;s nuthin&#039; but a G-<strong>sort of thing</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kirkaking">kirkaking</a>] 11-3-2012(6): Seriously? The <em>flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> roasted over a <em>fire</em>? Who would eat that<strong> sort of thing</strong>? (Notice how the flesh curls up from the heat.).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/basch2020">basch2020</a>] 9-9-2009(6): The flesh of flame grilled dogs is considered a delicacy in China, but its not the<strong> sort of thing</strong> people eat in the west.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73">zardoz73</a>] 9-2-2013(4): 然し 【しかし】 however;but 俄然 【がぜん】 suddenly;all of a sudden; abruptly 必然 【ひつぜん】inevitable;necessary 自然保護 【しぜんほご】nature conservation.Flesh of a dog over a cooking fire = &quot;hotdog&quot;. There are all sorts of things in hot dogs. Believe me, you don&#039;t want to know what<strong> sort of thing</strong>s . Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji.
