heisig: "This character refers to the block<i>headed</i>, persistent <b>stubbornness</b> of one who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the <i>beginning</i>, without letting anything that comes up along the way alter things in the least. The explanation makes &quot;sense,&quot; but is hard to remember because the word &quot;<i>beginning</i> &quot;is too abstract. Back up to the image we used two frames ago - Adam and Eve in their Eden - and try again: The root of all <b>stubbornness</b> goes back to the <i>beginning</i>, with two brothers each <b>stubbornly</b> defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled <i>heads</i>, each vying for the favors of heaven, a <b>stubborn</b> grimace on their faces. No wonder something unfortunate happened!"
