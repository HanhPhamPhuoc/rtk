heisig: The pictograph hidden in this character is of someone yawning. The first stroke shows the head thrown back; the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth; and the last two, the legs. Since yawning shows a <b>lack</b> of something (psychologically, interest; physiologically, sleep), the connection is plain to see.
