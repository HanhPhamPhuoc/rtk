## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 25-9-2007(372): She was <strong>beguiled</strong>/<strong>mislead</strong> by his charm: at the party he kissed her on the <em>mouth</em>, they did it on the <em>floor </em>and thus he stole her<em> heart</em>. Poor girl! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-1-2006(92): The same cowboy from frame # 356 (elements mouth, floor and fiesta), kisses the floor with his mouth, once again, before going to the fiesta. There, he uses his good looks to<strong> beguile</strong> women (gets them to buy him drinks or such), by playing with their hearts. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 30-4-2009(37): I like to think of this character as Guile from Street Fighter 2, <strong>beguiling</strong> Chun Li at the <em>fiesta</em>. He kisses her on the <em>mouth</em>, they do it on the <em>floor</em>. Then, remembering his job, he rips out her <em>heart</em>, Mortal Kombat style. &quot;which character are you gonna be?&quot; &quot;I&#039;m gonna <strong>be Guile</strong>&quot; (Partly inspired by nilfisq&#039;s). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 23-7-2008(31): This kanji actually means <strong>BEWILDERED</strong>. At the fiesta, he was kissing the floor with all his heart. Everyone was <strong>bewildered</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NickCooper">NickCooper</a>] 5-9-2008(12): At the fiesta I decided to<strong> beguile</strong> the crowd by performing a trick where I pull out my heart and throw it on the ground. It worked, their mouths hit the floor! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 8-4-2009(11): Everyone who has any skill at beguiling people will get this kanji in no time. Just throw your target a <em>fiesta</em>, and <em>kiss the ground</em> at their feet--you have to go straight for the <em>heart</em>, you see. With such flattery you can<strong> beguile</strong> them in no time. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tweenk">Tweenk</a>] 5-8-2007(6): The <em>mouth in the floor</em> (passage to the underworld) is surrounded by succubs that<strong> beguile</strong> you with promises of an eternal <em>fiesta</em>, but if you come in they will consume your <em>heart</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nekoyaki">nekoyaki</a>] 5-5-2009(4): You pretend to be<strong> beguile</strong>d by a vampire at the <em>fiesta</em>, but the instant he opens his <em>mouth</em> you knock him to the <em>floor</em> and stake his <em>heart</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 18-11-2008(4): At the <strong>fiesta</strong>, my <strong>heart</strong> was <strong><strong> beguile</strong>d</strong> by <strong>one</strong> kiss to the <strong>lips</strong> (mouth). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 12-3-2013(3): He has the power to<strong> beguile</strong> women and he uses it mercilessly. At the <em>fiesta</em> he approaches his target,<strong> beguile</strong>s her with his sly charm, kisses her on the <em>mouth</em> and shags her right there on the <em>floor</em>. He then moves on leaving her feeling like her <em>heart</em> has just been trampled ON. (thanks nilfisq).
