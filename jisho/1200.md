## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 17-4-2007(125): Ah, there&#039;s no better way to<strong> bake</strong> a pizza than an oven fueled by a <em>burning strawman</em>. And if you listen carefully, there are stifled strawman screams coming from the kitchen. Think of this image: <a href="http://users.mtrx.net/funnypics/content/-rdm1-ABCD1234-rdm1-/2005/2005-08-23-0002/Doughboy.jpg">http://users.mtrx.net/funnypics/content/-rdm1-ABCD1234-rdm1-/2005/2005-08-23-0002/Doughboy.jpg</a>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 4-10-2007(39): To the <em>fire</em> goes the <em>straw man</em>, thinking to<strong> bake</strong> a cake on it, but...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 2-3-2008(25): The best yakisoba / yakiimo / yakizakana / yakitori / yakiniku / takoyaki / taiyaki / shogayaki / sukiyaki / okonomiyaki / dorayaki / teriyaki / teppanyaki is made by burning a strawman.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 30-8-2006(20): I see the <em>strawman</em> as <em>The Wicker Man</em> (which incidentally I would recommend to all!). Without wanting to spoil the film for those who haven&#039;t seen it, let&#039;s just say that if you have seen the movie, this one is easy!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/partyrash">partyrash</a>] 28-1-2008(18): The straw man burning festival. Burning man music festival. I suppose a lot of people have lighters and matches there so they can get<strong> bake</strong>d, eh?

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(16): This is the story of the cute little <em>strawman</em> who was helping to<strong> bake</strong> cookies. Thinking he was being ever so helpful he climbed into the oven to check if they were nearly done. &quot;Hmm I think I can smell burning,&quot; he said &quot;I hope it&#039;s not the cookies...&quot; A moment later he realised his mistake. You can hear his screams as he staggers around helplessly on his little human legs, but he can&#039;t see for all the <em>fire</em>!!!! Oh the horror!!! Poor strawman :( .........[thanks akrodha].

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peterlasky">peterlasky</a>] 23-7-2009(11): I got<strong> bake</strong>d at Burning Man (where they light a giant <em>straw man</em> on <em>fire</em>).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Fluhk">Fluhk</a>] 19-5-2006(11): (Ignoring the straw man) - A jealous husband setting <em>fire</em> to the <em>haystack</em>, as he stumbles over his wife&#039;s and her lover&#039;s <em>legs</em> sticking out from underneath, leaving behind two<strong> bake</strong>d bodies...

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 5-3-2009(8): Think of the Wizard of Oz where the Wicked Witch of the West sets <em>fire</em> to the <em>straw man</em> and nearly<strong> bake</strong>s his ass!
