heisig: "The pictograph of two swinging <b>gates</b> is so clear in this kanji that only its stroke order needs to be memorized. In case you should have any trouble, though, you might doodle with the shapes on a piece of paper, taking care to note the difference in the stroke order of the two facing doors. The <b>gates</b> usually serve as an enclosure, and are written BEFORE whatever it is they enclose."
