## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 26-1-2008(308): <em>Spider-Man</em> is <em>hooked</em> on <em>rice</em>--it&#039;s all he<strong> inherit</strong>ed from his Uncle Ben. (thanks Nukemarine).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 5-4-2007(69): A poor chinese fisherman could expect to <strong>inherit</strong>: the <em>thread</em> for his pole, a <em>hook</em> for catching something to eat, and some <em>rice</em> to live off of. (not concentrating on stroke order, sorry if that throws anyone off). (Adapted from bigloui,12-4-2006).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 20-10-2007(40): The<strong> INHERIT</strong>ANCE given to SPIDERMAN was only RICE, because it came from his &quot;Uncle Ben&quot;, ha ha ha, get the HOOK? &quot;Uncle Ben&quot; RICE? To be fair, I couldn&#039;t work hook into that tale very well.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 14-11-2007(23): Uncle Ben <em>was</em> the employee that got the axe in <a href="../v4/1136">severance</a> (#1136 断), so naturally the <em>fishing hook</em> and <em>rice ball</em> is all that <em>spidey</em> will<strong> inherit</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui">bigloui</a>] 12-4-2006(11): A poor chinese farmer could expect to<strong> inherit</strong>: the <em>thread</em> of life, a <em>hook</em> for catching something to eat, and some <em>rice</em> to live off of. (not concentrating on stroke order, sorry if that throws anyone off).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/endote">endote</a>] 30-11-2010(10): <strong>Inherit</strong>ed businesses are usually one of three things in Japan. The threads of a tailor, the rice of a farmer or the hooks of the fisherman.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb">Mesqueeb</a>] 22-4-2009(6): [Primitive: rice and fishhooks = Sushi Bar] Spider-Man actually<strong> inherit</strong>ed Uncle Ben&#039;s SUSHI BAR. But he didn&#039;t want it, so that&#039;s why he was sad when Uncle Ben died.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 16-2-2008(6): This kanji has the meanings <strong>inherit</strong> and <strong>patch</strong>. Let&#039;s say you <strong>inherited</strong> an <em>american</em> jacket that has a hole in it. You don&#039;t have a needle, so you use a <em>hook</em> and some <em>thread</em> to <strong>patch</strong> it and look cool while doing so.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 27-2-2007(6): One reason <em>Black Widow</em> hates her parents is because all she<strong> inherit</strong>ed was a sack of <em>rice</em> and a <em>bent hook</em>! (Image: Black Widow in the lawyer&#039;s offering in disbelief at the rice and hook on the desk before her).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 10-11-2007(5): (+ Nukemarine) <em>Spiderman</em> <strong>inherits</strong> <em>rice</em> from uncle ben but what he wanted was uncle ben&#039;s priceless collection of fishing <em>hooks</em>. Unfortunately they were bequeathed to the fishing <em>hook</em> museum.
