heisig: "By <i>comparing</i> apes with anthropoids, we not only discover the latter have <b>descended</b> from those progenitors educated in the higher branches, but that the very idea of seeing everything <b>descended</b> from everything else, one way or another, means that there is &quot;nothing new UNDER the <i>sun</i>.&quot;"
