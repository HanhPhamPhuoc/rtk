## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 30-12-2006(261): The end is<strong> near</strong>. The <em>axe</em>-murderer is waiting for you on the <em>road</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zenkun">zenkun</a>] 13-3-2006(98): An absurd image, but working for me: two points A and B are separated by a long <em>road</em>. To make A and B<strong> near</strong>, take an <em>ax</em>, cut a big chunk of road, and the work is done.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 21-11-2007(60): Hint: Short- cut.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 14-9-2007(28): An <em>axe</em> left in the middle of the <em>road</em>! Dwarves must be<strong> near</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 7-6-2008(15): When I think of &quot;<strong> near</strong> &quot;, I always think of that absurd muppet sketch with Grover running back and forth to demonstrate &quot;<strong> near</strong> &quot; and &quot;far&quot;. So, I see grover on the <em>road</em> somewhere and I shout to him and ask him if he can show me &quot;<strong> near</strong> &quot;. He runs up to me and shouts &quot;<strong> Near</strong> !&quot;Then I kill him with my <em>axe</em> and sling him over my shoulder. We&#039;re having muppet for dinner tonight!Now that you all think I&#039;m insane, you should probably watch this, haha. <a href="http://video.aol.com/video-detail/eating-muppets/3865632416">http://video.aol.com/video-detail/eating-muppets/3865632416</a>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 4-2-2010(11): I always keep an AXE<strong> NEAR</strong> me when I am on the ROAD. You never know when you night need it...

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sdrobertm">sdrobertm</a>] 4-2-2011(4): An abandoned axe on the road could mean the axe murderer is<strong> near</strong>. &#039;Might want to get out of town if you care to live a while longer.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 26-5-2007(4): On the frontier, trails were usually &quot;blazed&quot; by marking the trees with an <em>axe</em>. Here, in response to your question, &quot;are we almost there yet?&quot; your guide looks up at the <em>axe</em> marks along the <em>trail</em> and says, &quot;yes, we are very<strong> near</strong>&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MrMorden">MrMorden</a>] 23-8-2009(3): A highwayman with an <em>axe</em> is<strong> near</strong> the <em>road</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-1-2008(3): Remember <a href="../284">environs</a> (#284 辺)? The environs are all those things in the <em>path</em> that are at close distance, so you can reach them with the point of your sword. Well, this kanji is for things even closer to you, because you can reach them with your <em>axe</em>, which is sensibly shorter than the sword. They must be really <strong>near</strong>.
