heisig: "The key word is actually a formal metaphor meaning &quot;humble acceptance.&quot; Reading off the two primitive elements in the order of their writing, we have: <i>nail</i> . . . <i>head</i>. As in &quot;hitting the <i>nail</i> on the <i>head</i>.&quot; Now one presumes that most people can handle metaphors, but if you were to run into a dimwit working in a hardware store who only knew the literal meaning of things, and were to ask him, in your best Japanese, to <b>place on your head</b> a nail, he might miss the point and cause you considerable torment."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 30-8-2007(284): If I put a <em>street sign</em> on my <em>head</em> what do I get ? A<strong> place on the head</strong> !

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 7-2-2008(68): <em>NAILS</em> - <strong>place directly on the <em>fore</em>head</strong>, <em>NAILS</em> - <strong>place directly on the <em>fore</em>head</strong>, <em>NAILS</em> - <strong>place directly on the <em>fore</em>head</strong>, The <strong>HEAD ON</strong> commercial <em>nail</em>s it into your <em>head</em>......

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 25-2-2008(57): You&#039;ve probably noticed that even the rudest and crudest Japanese say &quot;Itadakimasu&quot; before every meal. Why? Because each person who failed to say it as a child had a <em>nail</em> driven straight into that tender<strong> PLACE ON THE HEAD</strong> (i.e. the very top of the head). That&#039;s a lesson no one will forget!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wfreeman">wfreeman</a>] 3-2-2007(52): Driving down the STREET, looking at a PAGE in the map, I hit another car, and started bleeding from a<strong> place on the head</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matty0187">Matty0187</a>] 30-7-2009(21): <em>Nail</em> the <em>page</em> to the wall! <em>Place</em> a Bounty <em>On the head</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 28-1-2008(16): This formal metaphor for &#039;humble acceptance&#039; is taken seriously in Japan - so imagine a subservient employee kneeling and holding a nail to his head (specifically, the left side of his head) for his angry boss to hit!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 10-4-2008(12): チョウ　いただき　いただく　SUMMIT/TOP/RECEIVE HUMBLY: When the first mountain climber (a Japanese) reached the SUMMIT, he HUMBLY RECEIVED his prize (a golden snow picket resembling a giant NAIL) which he PLACED ON HIS HEAD with both hands while shouting &quot; 頂きます !!!&quot;　E.G. 頂点 （ちょうてん）apex; summit. 頂戴 （ちょうだい）する　to　receive, be given; be presented with a a thing [with thanks].

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elviswjr">elviswjr</a>] 13-9-2008(11): Humbly accept a nail being placed on the top of your head.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Foolio">Foolio</a>] 10-3-2010(7): This is to humbly receive. Japanese people bow in situations like this, often exaggeratedly so. You could imagine a Japanese person bowing so profusely upon accepting something that he could hammer in a nail with his head.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 25-12-2007(6): As I was walking down the <em>street</em> trying to understand the Japanese map <em>page</em> I walked straight into a <em>street sign</em> and got a big bump some<strong> PLACE ON THE HEAD</strong>.
