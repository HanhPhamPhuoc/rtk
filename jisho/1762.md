## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-3-2007(197): Kasparov practices <strong>deceit</strong> by grabbing your <em>rook</em> while pretending to <em>yawn</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 13-3-2007(128): Every day, a smuggler takes <em>bushel baskets</em> on donkeys across the border. But the border patrols can never arrest him for <em>lack</em> of evidence no matter how much they search the <em>bushel baskets</em>: they can&#039;t find whatever he is smuggling. What was his<strong> deceit</strong>? He was smuggling donkeys! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 28-2-2007(82): Bushel-basket = pictograph of chess rook (running over the board). Trying to deceive the opponent with a yawn while positioning a rook on the board. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 14-11-2009(59): Note - everyone uses this primitive to symbolize chess/rook in the following frames (don&#039;t bother with &quot;bushel basket&quot;). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberstuber">uberstuber</a>] 21-6-2007(31): <strong>Deceit</strong>! Someone must have moved one of my <em>chess pieces</em> while I waws <em>yawning</em>! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 30-9-2007(20): (thanks, guidedog) We think that <em>Garry Kasparov</em>&#039;s genius lies solely in his ability to think several moves in advance. The truth is that he frequently practises<strong> deceit</strong> by delaying his move to force his opponent to <em>yawn</em>. It is at this precise moment, that he shifts the position of key pieces on the board to gain a<strong> deceit</strong>ful advantage. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>] 14-3-2010(9): The Primitive bushelbasket is inconvenient imo. I think it looks like a <strong>Pokute</strong>, the funny little creatures from the hilarious anime &#039;Jungle wa itsumo Hale nochi Guu&#039;. Here&#039;s a short documentary about Pokute, you&#039;ll see the similarity! <a href="http://img71.imageshack.us/img71/6628/pokute3vp.gif">http://img71.imageshack.us/img71/6628/pokute3vp.gif</a> Story for<strong> deceit</strong>: A <strong>pokute</strong> is never tired, so when it&#039;s yawning, you know it&#039;s <strong>deceiving</strong> you. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 9-8-2010(8): Note: RTK3 has a similar kanji <a href="../2806">cheat</a> <span class="index">(#2806 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/騙">騙</a>)</span> which means &quot;deceive&quot;.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/欺">欺</a>   means &quot;deceit, cheat, delude&quot; so I changed   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/欺">欺</a>   to &quot;cheat&quot; and   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/騙">騙</a>   to &quot;deceive&quot;. Switching the keywords also matches the best stories for each kanji. Story (dingomick variation): Kasparov <strong>cheats</strong> by sneaking an extra <em>rook</em> onto the board when you close your eyes to <em>yawn</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark">mistamark</a>] 12-1-2009(6): It was a<strong> deceit</strong>! the <em>bushel basket</em> <em>lack</em>ed what I wanted. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shank">shank</a>] 26-2-2012(5): [Primitive: rook] What manner of<strong> deceit</strong> is this? I <em>yawn</em> for a brief second and now I&#039;m lacking a <em>rook</em>.
