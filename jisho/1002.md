## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(80): Before <a href="../v4/932">lacquer</a> (#932 漆) was made with water, it was made by draining this <em>body part</em> of fluid: the<strong> knee</strong>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 2-8-2008(44): Back in ancient Japan, people didn&#039;t have<strong> knee</strong> pads for things like rollerblading and such (what, come on. Ninjas on rollerblades. Ultimate 90s flashback). Instead, they would simply dip their <strong>knee</strong>s in <em>laquer</em>, and wait until it dried (hence the <em>flesh</em>, and the abscence of any <em>drops of water</em>). Unfortunately, this meant that you would have to wait about 30 minutes after deciding to go rollerblade until you could actually do it (took some time to dry) - and removing it was a serious pain.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 11-8-2009(31): The <strong>knee</strong>s are the <em>part of the body</em> that I protect with <em>lacquer</em>ed<strong> knee</strong>pads.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 7-6-2010(12): Don&#039;t<strong> knee</strong>l on the wet lacquer. When it dries your flesh will be stuck to it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mecreant">mecreant</a>] 7-8-2012(4): I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took and arrow in the<strong> knee</strong>. Now I have to wear a lacquered<strong> knee</strong> brace to protect my wounded flesh.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 7-11-2007(3): You don&#039;t have to <em>laquer</em> your whole <em>body</em>, just your<strong> knee</strong>s.<strong> Knee</strong> <em>laquer</em> vs elbow grease.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 4-8-2011(2): The <em>part of the body</em> with which I hit the <em>tree</em> was my<strong> knee</strong>. And as I hit the <em>tree</em> with my<strong> knee</strong> an <em>umbrella</em> and a rain of <em>grains of rice</em> fell off the <em>tree</em>. Dunno what they were doing up there, but they are now all below the <em>tree</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 2-8-2009(2): When I visited Japan, my<strong> knee</strong>s were always hurting from sitting seiza style. So I covered them in <em>lacquer</em>, and after the lacquer was dry (<em>no more drops of water</em>), this <em>part of my body</em> no longer bothered me.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 17-12-2011(1): I skidded the FLESH of my<strong> KNEE</strong>S when I fell from a TREE, trying to float on my UMBRELLA like Mary Poppins, falling on on a pile of RICE GRAIN.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(1): See nyquil&#039;s story from <a href="../v4/932">lacquer</a> (#932 漆). The <strong>knees</strong> are the <em>parts of the body</em> that Japanese children sit on while eating dinner off their <em>lacquered</em> Totoro plates.
