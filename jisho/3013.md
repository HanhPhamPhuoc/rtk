## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FooSoft">FooSoft</a>] 2-1-2010(7): I thought I finally got to team up with <em>Mr T</em> and take on the bad guys, but alas, it was nothing but a <strong>fleeting</strong> <em>dream</em> of mine.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/megaboyx">megaboyx</a>] 5-1-2010(1): <em>Mr T</em> came to realize how <strong>fleeting</strong> life was, like a <em>dream</em>, during his study as a monk [in my 僧 story) (BOU MOU hakanai kurai).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 17-2-2012(): <em>Chuck Norris</em> once was in my <em>dreams</em>, but it was such a <strong>fleeting</strong> moment that I can&#039;t remember what happened. I suppose I got kicked in the face and woke up.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 4-6-2011(): <em>Sheldon Cooper</em>, realizing how his life was <strong>fleeting</strong> by him, decided he&#039;d go into someone&#039;s <em>dream</em>, where time flows much more slowly, so he&#039;ll get more time to work on his theory of everything.
