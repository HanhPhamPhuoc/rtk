heisig: "<i>Tall children</i> <b>receive</b> more attention. <i>Tall children</i> grow up to make better wide <b>receivers</b>. Take your pick, depending on whether you prefer child psychology or American football. At any rate, be sure you have some particular <i>tall child</i> in mind, someone who really was outstanding and always attracting attention, because he or she will come in handy in the next two frames."

## Heisig story:

<i>Tall children</i> <b>receive</b> more attention. <i>Tall children</i> grow up to make better wide <b>receivers</b>. Take your pick, depending on whether you prefer child psychology or American football. At any rate, be sure you have some particular <i>tall child</i> in mind, someone who really was outstanding and always attracting attention, because he or she will come in handy in the next two frames.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 22-1-2007(138): In basketball however, tall children<strong> receive</strong> all the attention.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 30-11-2007(87): <em>Tall children</em><strong> receive</strong> all the attention. They also make great<strong> receive</strong>rs in football... this kanji also means &#039;catch&#039; (therefore a football<strong> receive</strong>r is a great image).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dragonslayer131">Dragonslayer131</a>] 19-11-2009(31): Kinda weird but I remember the weird ones best: A giant MOUTH wearing a TOPHAT<strong> RECEIVE</strong>S its next victim to munch on. This time its a small CHILD whimpering under the figure on the floor, scared of what is to come.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chaze">Chaze</a>] 11-5-2010(21): A word of warning: With Heisig&#039;s story I keep associating this with &quot;attention&quot;! I use something closer tied to the word<strong> receive</strong>: Imagine a bunch of kids finding an old radio. It&#039;s antenna is broken, so the <em>tallest</em> <em>kid</em> has to hold it up, and becomes the designated <strong>receiver</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cefreddffo">cefreddffo</a>] 15-10-2009(13): Usually in yaoi couples the short guy is the one who &quot;receives&quot;. But here we see how the <strong>tall boy</strong> is <em>receiving</em> and he <em>enjoys it</em> ( 享楽する ）. RTK2:　キョウ 享楽主義 きょうらくしゅぎ(hedonism).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame">yukkuri_kame</a>] 26-6-2009(9): Terrell Owens (Notice the Top Hat and Mouth are kinda like a T.O.) is a wide<strong> RECEIVE</strong>r who is a <a href="../v4/307">tall</a> (#307 高) big-<em>MOUTHED</em> jerk that whines like a <em>CHILD</em>. But he sure can catch and always<strong> receive</strong>s a big salary...enough to afford fancy <em>TOP HATS</em>. (thanks BigAmish).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chexxor">chexxor</a>] 23-6-2008(9): The thing this <em>child</em> <strong>received</strong> for his first birthday was a <em>top hat</em>. This <em>top hat</em> had a <em>mouth</em> so wide that the <em>child</em> could could fit his entire head into the hat.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 15-8-2008(7): The <em>tall child</em> is first to<strong> receive</strong> his acceptance letter to cram school, fatty has to catch up. (Based on Heisig&#039;s idea for <a href="../v4/309">cram school</a> (#309 塾).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 29-10-2007(5): [Image: children&#039;s basketball] <em>Tall kids</em><strong> receive</strong> all the attention. The following may help to contrast this kanji with <a href="../v4/735">accept</a> (#735 受). Receiving is generally a passive process -- for example, receiving attention. <strong>Accepting</strong> is slightly more active -- for example, <strong>accepting</strong> attention means coming to terms with <strong>receiving</strong> it.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxg">tritonxg</a>] 14-1-2010(4): [FR]recevoir japlt:N1 <strong>KYÔ ukeru</strong> kanji&amp;kana:1672 <em>chapeau haut de forme+bouche+enfant</em><strong> RECEVOIR ses 4 vérités :</strong> cela arrive même à un CHAPEAU HAUT DE FORME car la vérité sort de la BOUCHE des ENFANTS 享楽 【きょうらく】enjoyment;pleasure 享楽主義 【きょうらくしゅぎ】epicureanism;hedonism 生を享ける 【せいをうける】to live;to be born 享年 【きょうねん】one&#039;s age at death 享受 【きょうじゅ】 reception;acceptance being given,usufruit.
