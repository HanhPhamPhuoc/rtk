## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 25-10-2005(215): There&#039;s a road that&#039;s been<strong> inverted</strong>- it&#039;s gone from horizontal to directly vertical! The only beast that could possibly climb it is a mountain goat of course. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-5-2006(94): This reminds me of a cartoon I saw once, perhaps it was with Donald Duck. he is startled and furious when he chases this mountain billygoat further and further up the mountain road, untill the angle is so steep that he finds himself<strong> inverted</strong>. And falls down, while the goat stands solidly placed<strong> inverted</strong> and laughs a goaty laughter as Donald plumments and makes that typical Donald shaped cartoon crater at the bottom. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lankydan">lankydan</a>] 28-9-2007(30): <em>Mountain goat</em><strong> inverted</strong>. <em>Horns</em> stuck in <em>road</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-4-2007(26): You see a <em>mountain goat</em> on the <em>road</em>. Suddenly it is hit by a vehicle. The <em>mountain goat</em> somersaults through the air and lands back on the <em>road</em><strong> inverted</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 25-10-2009(12): The <em>mountain goat</em> had been hit by a car and lay<strong> inverted</strong> on the <em>road</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vitalyk">vitalyk</a>] 25-7-2011(5): It is easy.. if mountain goat falls from the mountain to the road, it always falls<strong> inverted</strong> (legs up): because horns are so heavy - so if you found such goat on the road, it is always<strong> inverted</strong>. Picture: https://sites.google.com/site/vitalykroivets/home/goat.gif?attredirects=0. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 5-1-2010(4): A mountain goat&#039;s road is<strong> inverted</strong> from normal. They walk straight up inclines that normal animals wouldn&#039;t even attempt. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dontpokebadgers">dontpokebadgers</a>] 25-7-2011(3): The u-turn (you can see a &quot;u&quot; and a &quot;t&quot; and you can make easier stories with it) road is<strong> inverted</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martie">martie</a>] 27-9-2010(3): Think of the movie INCEPTION: A <em>MOUNTAIN GOAT</em> on a<strong> INVERTED</strong> (up side down or so) <em>ROAD</em> wouldn&#039;t look so strange then. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 17-1-2010(3): Sakasama no hi (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/逆様の日">逆様の日</a>  ), or &quot;Inversion Day&quot;, is the Japanese national holiday on which everything is<strong> inverted</strong>, so you will see <em>mountain goats</em> that have been brought down to graze on the <em>roads</em> while the salarymen try to commute in their cars across the mountains.
