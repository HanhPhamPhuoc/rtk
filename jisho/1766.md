## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-4-2007(208): <strong>Go</strong> is <em>chess</em> played with <em>stones</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 7-2-2008(83): The ignorant gaijin put a <em>rook</em> on top of his opponent&#039;s <em>stone</em> when playing<strong> Go</strong>, much to the consternation of the Japanese players. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 17-9-2007(19): The two<strong> Go</strong> masters, playing on a gigantic <em>stone</em><strong> Go</strong> board, take their <em>stone</em> playing chips from huge <em>barrels</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark">mistamark</a>] 12-1-2009(17): <strong>Go</strong> needs a <em>bushel basket</em> full of <em>stone</em>s to play it. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 13-12-2006(8): I wanted to play <strong>Go</strong>, so I wanted to set up the board. I went for my <em>bushel basket</em>, where I keep all of the <em>stones</em>, but they fall out of the bottom! This is the same <em>bushel basket</em> that Charlie used in his escape! Now, I have nowhere to keep my <strong>Go</strong> stones. raulir 30-4-2006. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 25-6-2008(5): All of the black and white <em>stones</em> that belong to the<strong> Go</strong> board are neatly stored away in the <em>bushel basket</em>. Make sure you put them back the way you found them! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 4-6-2007(4): Help with primitive placement:<strong> Go</strong> doesn&#039;t require that many pieces, so imagine reaching deep down to the very bottom of this spacious bushel basket to get the few stones you need to play. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 30-12-2006(4): Just noting that the game is Chinese in origin, not Japanese, if anyone cares :-) The basket is obviously used for storing the stones. And curse Heisig for calling it &quot;Japanese checkers&quot; in RTK 2 :-(. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonkanji">jonkanji</a>] 11-7-2012(3): <strong>Go</strong> is <em>chess</em> played with tiny <em>stones</em>. Uh oh, one fell underneath the chessboard. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 13-5-2011(2): To play Japanese<strong> Go</strong> on a chess board just replace your <em>chess rook</em> with appropriately coloured <em>stones</em>, and you&#039;re ready to<strong> go</strong>!
