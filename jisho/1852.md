## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 26-7-2007(271): Your <em>son</em> plays in the<strong> corridor</strong> pretending he&#039;s exploring a <em>cave</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 17-8-2008(39): A<strong> corridor</strong> is a bastard <em>son</em> of a <em>cave</em>. <strong>Corridors</strong> dream too, hoping one day they&#039;ll be as great as their father, the cave.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 18-6-2008(30): (ロウ) I think of the<strong> corridor</strong> found in the <em>cave</em> that Yoda made Luke Skywalker walk through as part of his Jedi training in Empire Strikes Back. It was in this<strong> corridor</strong> that Luke met Darth Vadar, cut off his head and found himself behind Darth Vadar&#039;s mask. An early little hint that Luke was Darth Vadar&#039;s <em>son</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 18-2-2008(26): When I hear<strong> corridor</strong>, I think of a long, lonely hospital<strong> corridor</strong>. Imagine a war scene. Bombs are dropping from overhead. The good <em>sons</em>, who defended the city walls, are dropping like flies. The wounded <em>sons</em> are taken to the underground bomb shelter and hospital, in a <em>cave</em>. There are too many wounded <em>sons</em> for the hospital, so the wounded lie sprawled in the<strong> corridor</strong>, as the cave is still rocked by overhead bombs.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 5-11-2007(9): It would sure piss off superman if he found his <em>son</em> playing in the<strong> corridor</strong> pretending he&#039;s <em>batman</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/efeilliaid">efeilliaid</a>] 14-2-2010(6): The good son that stayed within the city walls to defend the city is now digging underground cave<strong> corridor</strong>s as part of the defence plan.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 6-11-2010(5): A <em>good city wall</em> will always have secret<strong> corridor</strong>s running under it leading to the <em>caves</em> beneath the city...it&#039;s traditional! 廊下 (ろうか) :<strong> corridor</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/flamehed">flamehed</a>] 19-6-2012(4): Your son plays in the<strong> corridor</strong> pretending he&#039;s exploring a cave. Thanks Raichu. Can&#039;t help but think of this.... <a href="http://pbfcomics.com/172/">http://pbfcomics.com/172/</a>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 20-5-2009(4): If your son goes into a dark<strong> corridor</strong> in a <em>cave</em>, he will have his butt raided by 1,000,000 dicks, just like in the movie Titanic.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 25-7-2009(3): [thanks Raichu] Your <em>son</em> builds a <em>cave</em> out of lego on the<strong> corridor</strong>, blocking the passage.
