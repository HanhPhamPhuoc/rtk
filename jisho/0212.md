heisig: The <b>tags</b> you see hanging on <i>trees</i> in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of <i>trees</i> they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the <b>tag</b> to the branch as a large <i>fishhook</i>. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again.
