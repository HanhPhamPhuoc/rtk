heisig: "One of the things that causes the erosion of <i>soil</i> is the excessive <b>pressure</b> of the top<i>soil</i> on the lower <i>soil</i>. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep <i>cliff</i> without a tree in sight. The <b>slightest</b> pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 30-7-2007(212): The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous<strong> pressure</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 4-8-2007(52): For physics people: p = F/A (p:pressure, F:Force, A:Area). Where the force is from the immensity of the cliff. The area on the cliff is covered by soil. So the equation becomes p = F/A = cliff/soil which preserves the position of the primitives.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 11-3-2008(38): The <em>cliff</em> exerts a lot of<strong> pressure</strong> on the <em>ground</em> beneath it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rasteps">rasteps</a>] 1-10-2006(24): The taller the <em>cliff</em>, the more<strong> pressure</strong> on the <em>soil</em> below it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 26-8-2008(10): Be careful of landslides! The <em>soil</em> under the <em>cliff</em> is under enormous<strong> PRESSURE</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea">lilpea</a>] 7-8-2007(8): Under<strong> Pressure</strong>, by Queen and David Bowie. Sing the tune with these words: It&#039;s the terror of knowing, What this <em>cliff</em> is about, Watching some good <em>soil</em>, Screaming let me out!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 2-3-2008(7): You&#039;ll need a great deal of <strong>pressure</strong> to flatten that <em>cliff</em> down to the same level as the <em>soil</em> below.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 5-11-2008(5): The dirt under the cliff is is under a lot of<strong> pressure</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 5-1-2010(4): Sedimentary rock is created by<strong> pressure</strong> on layers of soil. If you&#039;ve ever seen the exposed side of a cliff, you can see clearly the results of this<strong> pressure</strong> as you see all the impacted soil.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 12-6-2007(4): &quot;Under<strong> Pressure</strong> - cliff bearing down on earth...bearing down on earth...bearing down on earth...Under<strong> pressure</strong>.&quot;.
