heisig: "Unless you are a botanist, you are not likely to know what a <b>Japanese Judas-tree</b> looks like, and probably never even heard of it before, but the name is sufficiently odd to make remembering it easy. Using the primitives as our guide, we define it as a <i>tree</i> with <i>ivy</i> growing down its branches in the shape of a hangman's rope."
