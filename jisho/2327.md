heisig: "The sense of the key word here is the &quot;all-inclusive&quot; we find in terms like &quot;<b>Pan-</b>American Games.&quot; (It is also the character used in mathematics for &quot;partial&quot; as in partial differentials, in case you are a math major and want to take your story in that direction.) Instead of a <i>water</i> sports event that brings together the best talent, think of a meet of the region's most <i>mediocre</i> athletes, many of whom cannot even tread <i>water</i>. Now try to find a sponsor for the &quot;<b>Pan-</b><i>Mediocre</i> <i>Water</i> Sports Competition.&quot;"
