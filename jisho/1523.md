## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rhclaghorn">rhclaghorn</a>] 29-3-2008(146): <em>Acorn Power</em> is the people&#039;s way to<strong> CENSURE</strong> a congressman you don&#039;t agree with. Pelt your Senator with acorns today. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 8-8-2007(96): The liberal squirrel blogged that he would give all his ACORNS to congress if it would exercise its POWER to<strong> censure</strong> Bush and Cheney. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 15-3-2007(69): Animal Farm works for me - where the <em>hogs</em> have the greatest <em>power</em> of<strong> censure</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo">ezmoreldo</a>] 14-5-2008(66): Sorry, I know this is crude, but it&#039;s just so easy to remember: if you expose your acorns and your muscle in public, you&#039;ll be<strong> censure</strong>d. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 14-11-2006(29): <strong>Censure</strong> is the political equivalent of a &quot;strongly worded letter,&quot; according to Cornell&#039;s School of Law. It is a flex of muscle by congress against the current president, but it is a very weak one. Imagine<strong> censure</strong> as congress flexing as hard as it can, only to have a little <em>acorn</em>-sized bump of <em>muscle</em> pop up suddenly. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikemasen">ikemasen</a>] 7-12-2008(19): Fox News kept accusing Obama of using <em>ACORN</em> to get to <em>power</em>. Somebody should finally<strong> censure</strong> all the crap on fox news. RTK II:　ガイ　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/弾劾">弾劾</a>  　だんがい (impeachment).

If those little nuts can produce an oak tree, think what they can do for <em>muscle</em>-fibre!   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/弾劾">弾劾</a>   だんがい impeachment; accusation;<strong> censure</strong>; denunciation. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-3-2007(6): The <em>hogs</em> of Congress have immense <em>power</em> of <strong>censure</strong>. Careful.
