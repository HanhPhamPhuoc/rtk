## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(42): I was having <em>mutual difficulties</em> in my relationship. She was always the one wearing the <em>crown</em> and I was the one picking the <em>fruit</em>. In order to fix the problem I checked the<strong> glossary</strong> for &quot;<em>mutual difficulties</em>&quot; but found nothing. I guess we&#039;re going to have to <em>mutually end</em> our relationship.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 12-3-2010(27): When I went to <em>Headless Mutual</em>, the bank for tough London gangsters, I was given a pamphlet that said &quot;If you try&#039;a rip us off, we&#039;ll give you the rough end of a pineapple.&quot; I didn&#039;t quite understand this phrase, but it was important that I knew my legal obligations, so I consulted my <strong>Glossary</strong> of British Thieves&#039; Argot. The result: &quot;&#039;give one the rough end of a pineapple&#039;: lit. insert the <em>crown</em> of the <em>fruit</em> into the recipient&#039;s anus. Metaphorically used to mean &#039;to exact vengeance&#039;. Oh, I see now.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 2-4-2007(22): People who read the<strong> glossary</strong> are <em>mutually exclusive</em> (exclude the top line of <a href="../v4/757">mutually</a> (#757 互) ) from those who eat <em>crowned fruit</em> イ はりねずみ same kind 語彙 .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 26-1-2009(9): I was reading a recipe book but had trouble figuring out what a &quot;pineapple&quot; was. Thanks to the <em>one-way assisting</em><strong> glossary</strong> at the end, I learnt that a pineapple was a <em>crowned fruit</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BladeWalker">BladeWalker</a>] 27-7-2012(8): We had no idea what a <em>crowned fruit</em> was so we <em>mutually</em> checked the<strong> glossary</strong>. Well, I say mutually, but really I did all the work.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 3-4-2012(6): We gather in my class to learn VOCABULARY (=glossary) 語彙 . We check the words <a href="../v4/757">mutually</a> (#757 互). The one that guesses more words gets the CROWN. The one that guesses less words has to bring the <a href="../v4/1121">fruit</a> (#1121 果) . When the teacher is not in class supervising our exercises, we exclude the top line of <a href="../v4/757">mutually</a> (#757 互).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 7-4-2010(6): The<strong> glossary</strong> explains that <em>crowned fruit</em> in particular have a <em>mutually</em> beneficial relationship with humans. We eat them, spit the seeds out... and oh wait, I guess the mutuality really is just <em>one-sided</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 7-3-2009(3): They had a <em>mutually exclusive</em> interest, namely: reading <strong>glossaries</strong> about <em>crowns</em> shaped like <em>fruit</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 14-10-2010(2): 語彙 , 辞彙 , 彙報 <a href="../v4/2997">glossary</a> (#2997 彙) イ ... Parts:彑(old form of 彐), 冖, 果 ... Neobeo remix: Back in the back of the back of the book, in the<strong> glossary</strong> you read all the background info. How they named years after pigs, dogs, and rats; how they had all these various cycles. But the weirdest thing in the<strong> glossary</strong> were the pictures of <em>Old Brooms</em>. They would stick a stick in Pineapple (<em>crowned fruit</em>), and use it to sweep.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 29-5-2009(2): They had <em>mutually exclusive</em> interests like reading <strong>glossaries</strong> and eating pineapple (<em>crown</em>ed <em>fruit</em>). (thx brose, neobeo).
