## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-10-2008(50): What seemed to be <em>water</em> dripping from the <em>wooden</em><strong> roofbeam</strong> was actually <em>drops</em> of blood dripping from a <em>sword</em> lodged in it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 21-4-2007(10): He cut down the <em>tree</em> with a <em>sword</em> to make a new<strong> roofbeam</strong>, but when he saw <em>two drops</em> lying on the tree, he assumed there was too much <em>water</em> in the wood and he left it to dry first.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 12-7-2009(8): A while back, I was goofing around with my <em>sword</em> when I accidentally lodged it in the<strong> roofbeam</strong>. Apparently, I also poked a couple of holes in the roof because whenever it rains, some <em>water</em> drips onto the floor - <em>one drop from each side of the sword</em>. So that&#039;s why there is a <em>tree</em> growing on the floor now. :/.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 8-12-2008(2): <em>Water</em> is pouring in through the<strong> roofbeam</strong>s. You stick a <em>blade</em> in, and the flow subsides to just a couple of <em>drops.</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 1-7-2010(1): <em>Water</em> is used to clean the 2 <em>drops</em> of sap off the <em>sword</em> that cut the <em>tree</em> for the<strong> roofbeam</strong>. Pretty stupid carpenter if you ask me.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 18-2-2010(1): Adopting Heisig&#039;s suggestion for <a href="../1743">red</a> (#1743 赤), 刀 + 小 combined can create <em>little dagger</em> 刅. STORY: Before the &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot; the was the &quot;Little Dagger in the<strong> Roofbeam</strong>&quot;. No one could remove the <em>little dagger</em> because the <em>wood</em> was <em>water</em>logged and swollen. Arthur knew that if he waited until the water evaporated (shown by <em>water</em> element lifting above 木 ), the <em>little dagger</em> could be removed easily.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 9-2-2009(1): I cut down a <em>REALLY HUGE tree</em> with a <em>sword</em> to use it as a<strong> roofbeam</strong>, but it wasn&#039;t a perfect fit and <em>water</em> drips through it at a rate of <em>two drops</em> per second. (modified since I kept making water the major component).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gwindarr">Gwindarr</a>] 27-11-2008(1): Its raining hard outside and everything is soaked. Jason Voorhees (also soaked) and wielding his bloodied blade (with 2 drops of blood) jumps from atop a tree onto the cabin and crashes through the roof breaking one of the<strong> roofbeam</strong>s on his way down to cut up the counsleors.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/juandixonformvp">juandixonformvp</a>] 8-10-2012(): Adopting Heisig&#039;s suggestion for <a href="../1743">red</a> (#1743 赤), 刀 + 小 combined can create <em>little dagger</em> 刅. STORY: Before the &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot; there was the &quot;Little Dagger in the<strong> Roofbeam</strong>&quot;. Story: Arthur climbed a tree, pulled out the little dagger from the<strong> roofbeam</strong> and predictably water rushed out from the hole left behind. (gavmck).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Miyumera">Miyumera</a>] 18-7-2012(): A WOODEN roof beam was dripping WATER onto a SWORD and the sword would slice each droplet in half, so it would fall to either side.
