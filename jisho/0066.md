heisig: "Ever notice how the <b>texture</b> of your face and hands is affected by the <i>wind</i>? A day's skiing or sailing makes them rough and dry, and in need of a good soft cream to soothe the burn. So whenever a <i>part of the body</i> gets exposed to the <i>wind</i>, its <b>texture</b> is affected. (If it is any help, the Latin word hiding inside <b>texture</b> connotes how something is &quot;to the touch.&quot;)"
