A different reading is 盛り (もり), meaning a serving of food. In order to achieve <strong>peak</strong> performance, Takamisakari must turn into a plate-cleaning, eating machine. He is <em>turned into</em> a real fighter after cleaning his <em>plate</em> (think of a Hulk-like transformation). Therefore, the more <strong>servings</strong> of food he has, the more he experiences a <strong>boom</strong> in wrestling success. (Thanks to stories by cangy &amp; others.).
