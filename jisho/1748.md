2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(26): In the<strong> pitch dark</strong>, I can hear the <em>sound</em> of the <em>lesbians</em> rubbing their <em>gates</em> together.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 9-7-2010(22): I like to think of a horror movie where the protagonists enter a graveyard when suddenly their flashlights go out and it becomes<strong> pitch dark</strong>, whereupon they hear the <em>sound</em> of the <em>gate</em> creaking shut behind them.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 6-11-2007(16): When it is <strong>pitch dark</strong>, you must navi<em>gate</em> by <em>sound</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Louismi">Louismi</a>] 19-6-2011(4): I opened the gates and it was<strong> pitch dark</strong>. Only a eerie sound could be heard.

Note: Often swapped with 暗い <a href="../v4/480">darkness</a> (#480 暗), examples: 闇愚 =暗愚, ... Mantixen remix: in the<strong> pitch dark</strong>, one cannot hear the <em>sound</em> of the <em>lesbians</em> rubbing together. As opposed to breeders, and gay guys, who are noisy, what with they slapping and such.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kaame">Kaame</a>] 22-9-2012(1): When it&#039;s <strong>pitch dark</strong>, you have to find the <em>gate</em> by the squeaking <em>sound</em> it makes.
