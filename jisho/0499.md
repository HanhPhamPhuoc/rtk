## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-8-2007(185): <strong>Plums</strong> actually grow on every single tree. What, you didn&#039;t know that? They do. Orange trees, apple trees, cantaloupe trees.<strong> Plum</strong>s are simply mutant fruits that have been installed in the root software of every single tree. I hear that some<strong> plum</strong>-loving scientists are working on a way to hack <em>every</em> <em>tree&#039;s</em> genetic code so that <em>every tree</em> will bear nothing _but_<strong> plum</strong>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spoonz">Spoonz</a>] 1-3-2009(74): <em>every</em> man&#039;s <em>wood</em> has 2<strong> plum</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/henroski">henroski</a>] 30-1-2008(66): EVERY Japanese person asks you if you like UMEBOSHI. No I say, I prefer to eat my<strong> PLUM</strong>S fresh from the TREE.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sevenhelmets">Sevenhelmets</a>] 30-7-2008(30): <em>Every</em> <em>tree</em> should be a <strong>plum</strong> <em>tree</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dagur">Dagur</a>] 19-11-2008(28): <strong>Plum</strong> <em>trees</em> have fruit on <em>every</em> branch.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/firebound12">firebound12</a>] 5-1-2009(26): 梅干 Umeboshi (dried<strong> plum</strong>) is usually placed in <em>every</em> bento at the center of the rice to represent the flag of Japan. From Wikipedia.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TwoGoats">TwoGoats</a>] 8-9-2009(10): This TREE has a<strong> plum</strong> on EVERY branch.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 23-11-2007(10): Prof<strong> Plum</strong> is actually an evil genius. He wants to hack the genetic code to make every tree bear nothing but<strong> plum</strong>s! [dihutenosa].

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 4-1-2007(8): Eve&#039;s<strong> plum</strong>, picked from the <em>Tree</em> of Knowledge, brought sin upon <em>every</em> man.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woodwojr">woodwojr</a>] 2-6-2008(7): One morning, the apple-trees in the orchard started producing<strong> plum</strong>s. We thought it was strange, but gave it no mind. The peach trees were next, then the pears, and eventually the kumquats. <em>Every</em> <em>tree</em> was making<strong> plum</strong>s. When they went and killed a chicken, its flesh was all<strong> plum</strong> flesh. Just last week, Ms. Jones fell down and her leg just squished, letting out<strong> plum</strong> juice everywhere. I don&#039;t know how long it&#039;s going to be until <em>every</em> thing is just<strong> plum</strong>s.
