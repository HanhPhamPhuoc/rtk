heisig: "The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality; hence we refer to it as "<b>sort of thing</b>." Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (See frame 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an <i>oven flame</i> with the <i>flesh</i> of a <i>chihuahua</i> being thrown into the whole concoction to make it into a "hot-diggity, dog-diggity" <b>sort of thing</b>."
