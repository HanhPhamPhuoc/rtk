## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 27-8-2006(570): We printed a japanese flag on his white towel by stabbing him with a saber while he was wearing it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 21-12-2007(73): The image that keeps coming to me is of the giant mechanical<strong> printing</strong> presses. The <em>cloth</em>-based material is coming off the roll like a flag and then, after<strong> printing</strong>, gets cut into sheets by <em>saber</em>-like cutting tools.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 1-2-2008(22): You&#039;re short of paper, so you try<strong> printing</strong> on a towel. Your unhappy printer shows you a red flag but when you show it your sword it becomes very obedient and starts<strong> printing</strong>. Awful quality, but the printer did what it could...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 30-10-2008(13): Modern laser printers can print on flags and towels with saber-like precision.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 14-5-2008(10): Before the invention of the<strong> printing</strong> press, there were many failures, such as the peeing press. Yep, having people <em>pee</em> onto <em>towels</em> that had letters cut into them with <em>sabers</em> just didn&#039;t work very well.. (note: I use &quot;pee&quot; for the &quot;flag&quot; primitive.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivantolearnkanji">ivantolearnkanji</a>] 21-3-2008(10): All they do in this rag (e.g. the New York Post) is flag-waving and saber-rattling.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sir_sanuk">sir_sanuk</a>] 7-1-2011(7): <strong>Printing</strong> a Japanese <em>flag</em> on someone is easy. Just wait until they&#039;re wearing a white towel, stab them with your sabre and watch the red circle form.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(6): One day, I broke into Gutenberg&#039;s shop to use his<strong> printing</strong> press. Instead of using paper, I printed the news on a <em>flag</em>. I thought it was funny; Gutenberg didn&#039;t. He was standing there wearing only a <em>towel</em> and carrying a <em>saber</em>. Apparently, he had just finished bathing. He swung the saber at me, but I dodged. Unluckily for him, he slashed right through the<strong> printing</strong> press.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Onikagii">Onikagii</a>] 23-9-2009(4): The flag<strong> printing</strong> factory prints many copies of one flag onto giant towels which are then cut into the flags by sabres.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Seiska">Seiska</a>] 19-6-2010(3): This towel has a pirate flag printed on to it, sabers and a skull.
