heisig: "The mounds of <i>soil</i> with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill <b>graves</b> we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the <i>soil</i> comes UNDER the <i>graveyard</i>, rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as &quot;lying under boot-hill&quot; if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji."
