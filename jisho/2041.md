His concerned family is having his picture printed on the backs of receipts and even on stamps. So far, however, there has been no<strong> SIGN OF THE HARE</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 8-11-2007(118): <em>rabbit ears</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 10-9-2007(65): Identical to <em>egg</em>, without the &quot;yolks.&quot; Both hares and eggs are used for Spring celebrations because they are symbols of fertility. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 8-1-2009(48): The<strong> sign of the hare</strong> is an Easter Bunny, with it&#039;s eggs that have no yoke (instead, they have candy). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-7-2006(9): In this version of the story of the &quot;Turtle and Rabbit Run a Race&quot;, the rabbit stops on his way to a shop where they sell <em>stamps</em>, just meters away from the finishing line. In the shop, the rabbit quickly forgets about time and spends hours looking at stamps, finally after choosing a good hundred <em>stamps</em> to buy, he receives a very long <em>receipt</em>, and pays for them. He leaves the shop with stamps in one hand and the receipt in the other, and you guessed it... the turle won the race. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DeKleft">DeKleft</a>] 9-12-2007(5): The reciepts and stamps don&#039;t have eggs spilled on them from the Easter bunny this year. It must be a<strong> sign of the hare</strong> who has changed his ways from evil to good. <a href="../1422">egg</a> <span class="index">(#1422 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/卵">卵</a>)</span> from Dingomiks in egg.
