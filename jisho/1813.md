## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 7-5-2007(254): For <em>insects</em> to get in<strong> contact</strong> with each other, they need to place their antennae at just the right <em>angle</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-12-2007(70): Wow, he threw that BOOMERANG with such skill, it made<strong> CONTACT</strong> with that INSECT in mid flight.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 9-7-2006(31): This is commonly read as 触る （さわる）, meaning to touch or feel something. An <em>insect</em>&#039;s version of <em>horns</em> are its antennae (see <a href="../1813">contact</a> (#1813 触)). They are it&#039;s prime source of<strong> contact</strong> with the world and it uses them to touch and feel its way around.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 26-9-2007(28): Th e physics professor explains that, depending on the<strong> contact</strong> <em>angle</em>, the <em>bugs</em> hitting your windshield may splatter really good!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thairob">thairob</a>] 15-1-2008(14): In the movie<strong> CONTACT</strong>, Jodie Foster has to turn the radio telescope at just the right ANGLE in order to pick up the alien signal. Unfortunately, just as she&#039;s found the perfect ANGLE, a huge INSECT lands on the receiver and scrambles the signal. Jodie has to bust ass and call her friend in Australia to pick up the signal.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 18-1-2009(13): The <em>bug</em> came in<strong> contact</strong> with the windshield at a sharp <em>angle</em>. It didnt make it.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narazumono">narazumono</a>] 15-1-2009(7): Your<strong> contact</strong> lens is at a funny <em>angle</em> because an <em>insect</em> got behind it, and is making<strong> contact</strong> with your eyeball. (gross!!<strong> Contact</strong> the doctor immediately).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 14-7-2008(7): For this character, I can usually recall the <em>insect</em> part. And so I imagine a <em>fly</em> on the board of a math class, on which a <em>triangle</em> is drawn. The <em>fly</em> is inching its way slowly to one of the <em>angles</em>. Closer...closer....closer....until it finally makes<strong> contact</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 7-6-2007(5): &quot;For insects to get in<strong> contact</strong> with each other, they need to place their antennae at just the right angle.&quot; Imagine them using a miniature <em>T-square</em> to get their angle right.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-1-2007(3): The antennae of this insect look like right angles, and it uses them to<strong> contact</strong> (touch) objects. (see <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Insect_antennae.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Insect_antennae.jpg</a> for an example). An insect antenna is, by the way, written 触角 .
