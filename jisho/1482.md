2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 14-1-2008(75): To avoid confusing with <a href="../677">contraption</a> (#677 械), focus on the &quot;ism&quot; of<strong> mechanism</strong>. For example, fetishism refers to having a fetish;<strong> mechanism</strong> here refers to having a mecha-like property, where mecha is a type of anime robot that can transform itself. Imagine a mecha that can transform itself between two forms: a huge immovable <em>tree</em> (as a form of defense) and a gigantic marching <em>abacus</em> that smashes enemies between its giant beads.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 12-2-2009(39): [synewave]An <em>abacus</em> is a<strong> mechanism</strong> made of <em>wood</em> used to calculate <em>how many</em> &#039;anythings&#039;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 8-1-2010(14): Uh-oh. You accidentally hit the self-destruct<strong> mechanism</strong> on your <em>abacus</em>. You hide behind a <em>tree</em> and wait for the explosion.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 12-7-2009(7): The <em>tree</em> in the Princess Bride had a secret<strong> mechanism</strong> inside it--you use the <em>abacus</em> to choose how many years of life it sucks away.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EKeiko">EKeiko</a>] 13-1-2013(3): Remember that scary torture<strong> MECHANISM</strong> in the Princess Bride? You enter through the TREE, and there you will see the evil prince choosing HOW MANY years of life the<strong> MECHANISM</strong> would suck away from poor Wesley... (thanks elmaestrokgb) (Princess Bride Tree<strong> Mechanism</strong>...).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiVirtuoso">KanjiVirtuoso</a>] 8-8-2011(3): The <em>Abacus</em> 3000! With sophisticated <em>wooden</em><strong> mechanism</strong>s, it does all the calculating for you. Just look at all those little cogs go.
