heisig: "<b>Determination</b>, in the sense of settling on a certain course of action, is likened here to <i>mending</i> one's <i>house</i>. mending(szycie cerowanie) This primitive differs from the kanji for correct only by the movement added to the last two strokes, the &quot;-ing&quot; of mending if you will. But take a more concrete sense, like mending holes in socks. [5]"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jrothenberg">jrothenberg</a>] 31-1-2007(231): In The Karate Kid, the boy must prove his determination by MENDING his teacher&#039;s HOUSE in various ways.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hanako1975">hanako1975</a>] 14-1-2008(50): People who decide to renovate (ooh, that&#039;s a fancy word, let&#039;s say <em>&quot;mend&quot;</em>) their <em>houses</em> must be very<strong> determine</strong>d DIYers. (Using DIY helps me remember this story when I see<strong> DEtermine</strong>).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 4-7-2008(36): 定める 【さだめる】 (v1,vt) to decide; to establish; to<strong> determine</strong>; (P)The primitive &quot;mend&quot; is too arbitrary and I can never remember it. New primitive meaning: CORRECT PERSON: Do you see the 4th and 5th stroke? They look like the kanji for &quot;person.&quot; Therefore, CORRECT + PERSON = CORRECT PERSON. STORY: I DECIDED/DETERMINED I would fix my HOUSE this summer but am still looking for the CORRECT PERSON to do it (i.e. a contractor).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 4-10-2008(5): To me, the primitive in the house is a <em>perfectionist</em> (<a href="../v4/379">correct</a> (#379 正) + <a href="../v4/951">person</a> (#951 人)). Not only is the <em>perfectionist</em> worried about his marriage (see <a href="../v4/388">just so</a> (#388 是) and <a href="../v4/665">propose</a> (#665 提)), he also<strong> determine</strong>s to the tiniest detail how to run his <em>house</em>.
