heisig: "Ah, but haven't modern <i>graveyards</i> become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing <b>imitation</b> <i>trees</i> in the <i>graveyard</i>. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 21-1-2008(149): If I find out this furniture you&#039;re selling me is made of<strong> imitation</strong> <em>wood</em>, I&#039;ll put you in the <em>graveyard</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 15-1-2008(67): The Japanese are so enamored of everything plastic, they even put<strong> IMITATION</strong> plastic <em>trees</em> in their <em>graveyards</em>! (No, not really, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 29-12-2009(40): This kanji was a real asshole. No one liked this kanji. That is why that when this kanji died, no one cared, and it received a <em>wooden</em>,<strong> imitation</strong> tombstone; not a fancy marble one, at its resting place in the <em>graveyard</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek">peepiceek</a>] 14-5-2008(22): The<strong> imitation</strong> <em>tree</em> looked like a <em>big sun flower</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 8-5-2006(21): <strong>imitation</strong>: we left a wodden sculpture (an <strong>imitation</strong>) at the <em>graveyard</em> of our old dog. (<strong>graveyard</strong>: were we put <em>flowers</em> for our deceased <em>big St. Bernard</em>, good ol&#039; <em>Sunny</em>). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 4-5-2007(16): In <em>graveyards</em>, everything is fake, the <em>flowers</em>, the <em>sun</em>, and the little happy <em>dogs</em>. Heck, even the <em>trees</em> are just<strong> imitation</strong>s. It&#039;s a clean aesthetic that&#039;s supposed to help people recover, but all the<strong> imitation</strong> material really unnerves me. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 30-1-2010(14): I did such a good<strong> imitation</strong> of a <em>tree</em> by staying perfectly still that they sent me to the <em>graveyard</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 12-11-2008(7): Lol @ all the fake<strong> imitation</strong> trees in the graveyard. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 13-11-2009(6): Don&#039;t use<strong> imitation</strong> <em>wood</em> to make crosses for the <em>graveyard</em> (Graveyard primitive - Against a <em>rose</em>y sky, the <em>sun</em> set over the <em>large</em> graveyard.). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 10-10-2007(6): <em>Tree</em>s in <em>graveyard</em>s are part of the attempt to create an<strong> imitation</strong> of heaven for the souls buried there.
