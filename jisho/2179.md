6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 10-7-2008(7): This kanji made me think that TRUTH needed a physical image, so I&#039;ll use the generic photo of JESUS (known for the quote &quot;I am the Truth and the Light&quot; I think). Anyway, there was not enough SOIL to cover up JESUS, so he was STUFF&#039;d UP inside a hole for three days or so.

And if that&#039;s the case, you <em>truthfully</em> can take it and <strong>stuff it up</strong> the place you <em>soil</em> yourself from!
