## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 16-5-2007(172): Why are the roads leading through the woods so sticky and dirty? Hmm... I think the forest ranger<strong> mention</strong>ed something about excess <em>resin on the roads</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(112): No-body <strong>mention</strong>ed that there was <em>resin</em> on the <em>road</em>. Now I&#039;m stuck!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 23-1-2008(52): The resin factory worker sees the boiler about to explode and hesitantly says to his boss, &quot;um, there&#039;s something I should<strong> mention</strong> to you...&quot; At that moment the factory explodes and sends an overflowing batch of resin is cascading down the road bringing fiery death. (Semi-true story, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Molasses_Disaster">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Molasses_Disaster</a>).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 24-1-2010(30): Resin <strong>Primitive</strong>: Cell Phone tower. They make <em>cell phone towers</em> look like <em>trees</em> by putting <em>fake branches</em> on them, but you know it&#039;s just a metal pole. The <em>antenna</em> at the top is a dead giveaway. <strong>Story</strong>: On the top 10 list of dumbest ideas, placing a <em>cell phone tower</em> in the middle of the road earned an honorable<strong> mention</strong>. I nearly hit it everyday when I drive to work.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kyle_N">Kyle_N</a>] 2-4-2008(21): Did I<strong> mention</strong> this road was freshly resined and you shouldn&#039;t walk on it? Sorry too late, sucker!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TaylorSan">TaylorSan</a>] 14-4-2009(13): If you get pulled over on the <em>road</em>, be sure not to<strong> mention</strong> the <em>resin</em> you were smokin&#039;, when the cop asks you if you&#039;re stoned.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paramausi">paramausi</a>] 29-6-2009(10): (Primitive: Hobo (neither ホ nor　ボ)) &quot;There is a <em>hobo</em> on the <em>road</em>!&quot; &quot;Ah, I&#039;m glad u<strong> mention</strong>ed it.&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 3-3-2008(8): (Thanks Samuize) They<strong> mention</strong>ned on the radio that it&#039;s better to avoid that <em>road</em> because of the overspilling of a <em>resin</em> truck causing a terrible mess.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aboros">aboros</a>] 1-10-2009(7): To critics, resin on a boulevard is true <a href="../1525">art</a> (#1525 術). <em>resin</em> on a <em>road</em> only deserves honorable<strong> mention</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mrnarse">mrnarse</a>] 4-9-2009(5): <em>resin</em> = <em>ho</em> (ホ) + <em>a drop</em> = a <em>pimp</em>, cause a <em>pimp</em> will <em>drop</em> a <em>ho</em> if she&#039;s outta line. The primitive even looks like a <em>pimp</em> strutting around with his <em>pimp</em> hat on with a feather on top (the <em>drop</em>). Story: You <em>drop</em> a <em>ho</em> off on the road and pay the <em>pimp</em> his money plus a little extra. The <em>pimp</em> says &quot;Thank you.&quot; And you say &quot;Don&#039;t<strong> mention</strong> it.&quot;.
