heisig: "This primitive (named for its associations with the kanji of the following frame) is composed of a pair of <i>horns</i> growing out of a <i>brain</i> with a <i>tongue wagging in the mouth</i> beneath. Think of "<b>former</b>" in connection with administrators or heads of state who have just left office but continue to make a nuisance of themselves by advertising their opinions on public policy."
