heisig: "What we have to do here is turn a <i>shellfish</i> into a <b>page</b> of a book. The <i>one</i> at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact only <i>one</i> <b>page</b>.

As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a HEAD (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for HEAD (FRAME 1441 頭).

Here&#039;s something that I figured out way too late. This is <em>ALWAYS</em> <em>ALWAYS</em> on the right hand side (RHS) of the characters it is a part of. <em>Always</em>.. Learn this primitive cold, and remember, always on the RHS.
