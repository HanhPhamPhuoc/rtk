heisig: Japanese counts higher numbers in units of <b>ten thousand</b>, unlike the West, which advances according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read "four <b>ten-thousands</b>" by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to <i>bind up</i> a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for <i>one</i> and <i>bound up</i> naturally come to form <b>ten thousand</b>. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for <i>bound up</i> in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together.
