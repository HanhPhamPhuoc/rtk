## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(204): Let <em>wood</em>en <em>goods</em> = <em>furniture</em>. Then: Walking along the sea shore you see some washed-up <em>furniture</em> with <em>water</em> (waves) splashing against it. From a distance it looks like <em>flowers</em> are growing out the top, but as you get closer you see it is in fact<strong> seaweed</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 30-12-2007(50): Take<strong> seaweed</strong> (<em>water</em> + <em>flower</em>) and hang it to dry in a <em>tree</em> to produce nori <em>goods</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-3-2007(30): <strong>Seawood</strong> is the <em>flower</em> of the ocean. When you pile as <em>goods</em> on a <em>pallet</em> they drip <em>water</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 22-6-2006(16): Goods + wood = paper. You know how nori, ie:<strong> seaweed</strong>, comes in sheets for putting in your ramen or for your sushi? Well that&#039;s because it&#039;s water paper!<strong> Seaweed</strong> is also a sea flower of sorts, so it all just works out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 28-4-2009(10): Real<strong> seaweed</strong> serves as furniture for all the sea creatures.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delbertmon">delbertmon</a>] 28-1-2010(9): <strong>Seaweed</strong> is the <em>flowers</em> of the <em>water</em>. To sell as <em>goods</em> it must first be dried out in <em>trees</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 31-3-2006(8): I see the combination of the elements <em>goods</em> and <em>wood</em> as almost a pictograph of <em>goods on wooden pallets</em> (as in a depot, moved by lift trucks). Here some <em>goods on wooden pallets</em> have been left outside on the docks, the tide (<em>water</em>) came up, and they are now covered in<strong> seaweed</strong>, and some kind of <em>flowers</em>. When the workers are back they take the <em>flowers</em> for the wife, and they grab the<strong> seaweed</strong> to make Nori (dried<strong> seaweed</strong> sheets).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 19-10-2009(6): The <em>birds chirping in the trees</em> (which are actually palm trees) are a rare species whose diet consists mainly of<strong> seaweed</strong> <em>flowers</em>. They&#039;ve developed a special ability to dive into the <em>water</em> and pick the <em>flowers</em> right off the<strong> seaweed</strong> strands. (<em>Goods</em> over <em>tree</em> is a rare kanji that means <em>birds chirping in the trees</em> - see <a href="../215">parch</a> (#215 燥)).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fergal">fergal</a>] 25-11-2009(3): You have a really annoying Japanese co-worker who loves <strong>seaweed</strong> so much that he brings the <em>plants</em> still <em>dripping</em> into the office and hangs the to dry on the <em>office furniture</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asriel">Asriel</a>] 13-7-2009(3): Each thing <a href="../299">fall</a> (#299 落)s in its own way, and so when<strong> seaweed</strong> falls, it makes <em>furniture</em> for the fish to sit on :D.
