heisig: "There are really only 2 primitives here, <i>little</i> and <i>human legs</i>. The 4th stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn't make sense, try writing the kanji without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your beginner's eye.) Now if you have wondered what those little particles of &quot;dust&quot; are that dance around in the light-<b>rays</b> that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as <i>little</i> and disembodied <i>human legs</i>, and you should have no trouble with this character."
