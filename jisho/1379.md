## Heisig story:

Wooden leg . . . feathers . . . turkey.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 10-5-2007(140): Well, there are weekdays <a href="../v4/576">weekday</a> (#576 曜) and there are laundry days <a href="../v4/577">laundry</a> (#577 濯), and on February 29th<strong> leap</strong> day, the manufacturer recommends servicing or replacing your <em>peg leg</em> because they tend to wear out every 4 years.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 19-4-2008(120): [Story for people following katsuo in making feathers+turkey a &#039;futon&#039; primitive] If you&#039;re going to <strong>leap</strong> from a high place, better hope there&#039;s a <em>futon</em> below -- otherwise you&#039;re going to break your <em>leg</em> at the very least...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 31-8-2010(80): Tip: <em>feathers</em> + <em>turkey</em> : This combination of primitives appears six times in Heisig, so it&#039;s worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest &quot;<em>futon</em>&quot; (your <em>futon</em> is made from <em>turkey feathers</em>). REF: <a href="../v4/576">weekday</a> (#576 曜) , <a href="../v4/577">laundry</a> (#577 濯), <em>leap</em> (FRAME 1285), <a href="../v4/2272">outstanding</a> (#2272 擢), <a href="../v4/2534">twinkle</a> (#2534 燿), <a href="../v4/2880">shimmering</a> (#2880 耀). Story: I<strong> leap</strong> out of bed so fast that my <em>wooden leg</em> gets left behind in the <em>futon</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marydj">marydj</a>] 2-11-2007(41): The <em>turkey</em> with a <em>peg leg</em> is trying to<strong> leap</strong> across the canyon. He flaps his wings wildly and <em>feathers </em> fly but he doesn&#039;t make it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 20-12-2006(30): I&#039;ve always imagined a<strong> leap</strong> involving one leg instead of two, which would be a jump. Using your only good <em>leg</em> for propulsion, not the <em>pegleg</em>, you try to<strong> leap</strong> over the canyon. Even with the aid of <em>feathers</em>, you fly like a <em>turkey</em> and fall like stone. This is very Roadrunneresque.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 12-8-2009(9): Imagine Makoto from &quot;The Girl who <strong>Leapt</strong> Through Time&quot; ( 時をかける少女 ) tripping and hitting her <em>leg</em> on a <em>futon</em> as she&#039;s clumsily trying to<strong> leap</strong> through time in her house.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Innocenced">Innocenced</a>] 8-1-2012(8): I tried to <strong>leap</strong> over the <em>turkey</em> but I hit it with my <em>wooden leg</em> and <em>feathers</em> flew everywhere.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 7-8-2008(8): A <em>wooden leg</em>, <strong>leaping</strong> in your <em>futon</em>. Not good.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 26-1-2008(5): Sam quantum<strong> leap</strong>s into a <em>turkey</em> with a <em>peg leg</em> and paralyzed <em>wings</em>. This is going to be one difficult episode.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asakk">Asakk</a>] 24-6-2009(4): Link, from Zelda, wants to<strong> LEAP</strong> to the other side (and to<strong> leap</strong> you use your &#039;LEG&#039;, of course, and since his boots are brown, they resemble wooden legs,hm...), but the other side is too far away, so he gets a &#039;TURKEY&#039; (yeah, it&#039;s a chicken in the game,but...), so just imagine as he<strong> LEAP</strong>S holding the animal above his head, and the TURKEY flapping his wings with all it can, and a lot of FEATHERS flying (just like in the game).
