## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm">adhmm</a>] 23-11-2007(131): Someone stole all the<strong> wheel</strong>s off the ladies&#039; cars at the scrapbook convention.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 17-9-2007(112): During a talk at the <em>academic conference</em>, speaker shows an introductory slide depicting the structure of <em>car</em>, and then moves on to the more narrow topic of <strong>wheels</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 19-8-2009(45): At an <em>academic conference</em> many thousands of years ago, the uses of the<strong> wheel</strong> were discussed--eventually leading to the invention of the <em>car</em>. I sort of imagine a TED conference with cavemen discussing the<strong> wheel</strong> with a 2001 Space Oddesy-esc transition to Henry Ford also at a TED conference. (www.ted.com A seriously good website).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 5-3-2007(16): You have to be <em>methodical</em>. Before you invent the <em>car</em>, you&#039;ll need to invent the<strong> wheel</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-7-2007(15): It&#039;s a strange <em>scrapbook</em> <em>meeting</em> with albums full of <em>cars</em> and<strong> wheel</strong>s.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 11-2-2010(10): While I was driving to the <em>scrapbook convention</em>, all four<strong> wheel</strong>s fell off my <em>car</em>. However, this convention was too important to miss, so I kept driving there anyway.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/natcxyz99">natcxyz99</a>] 6-7-2010(5): The main speaker takes a<strong> wheel</strong> from his <em>car</em> to the <em>academic conference</em> and holds it up just to make a point: --Are we here to reinvent the<strong> wheel</strong>? Of course not! This conference is about bigger and better ideas (throws<strong> wheel</strong> offstage).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 8-12-2006(4): <strong>Wheel</strong> - related to <em>cars</em>...what a boring <em>Panini sticker album</em> that would be...collecting pictures of<strong> wheel</strong>s. No thanks!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 10-8-2009(3): A group of <em>car</em> enthusiasts get together in a <em>meeting</em> and show their <em>scrapbooks</em> of great <strong>wheels</strong> they have seen. They keep photos of all the good<strong> wheel</strong>s they see and swap notes on them (yes, they are dull).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 29-9-2007(3): At the ferris<strong> wheel</strong> design meeting, one designer showed a picture from a <em>scrapbook</em> of an old ferris<strong> wheel</strong> that had used <em>cars</em> for carriages.
