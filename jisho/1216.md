## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 30-1-2006(219): Your car has been savagely (see steadily) attacked by an ax. It will be some days before your car is fixed. So you are<strong> temporarily</strong> without car.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 24-5-2008(107): Today is Car Axe Day. The day where you can<strong> temporarily</strong> (today only) attack cars using an axe without punishment.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 1-5-2009(27): The top kanji is <a href="../v4/2092">chop off</a> (#2092 斬).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tenken3">tenken3</a>] 17-5-2007(21): Axe murderer hiding in a car<strong> temporarily</strong> for a few days after killing someone.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-1-2008(15): [<a href="../v4/2092">chop off</a> (#2092 斬) ... day] During daylight saving time, we <strong>temporarily</strong> <em>chop off</em> the <em>day</em> by taking an hour out of it, which we will return back in six months.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 20-1-2008(12): Vandals break your car with an ax and you<strong> temporarily</strong> have to use other transportation for a few days.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gwindarr">Gwindarr</a>] 26-7-2007(8): The axe murderer stands over your car as you pull into the space to remind you that you can only park here<strong> temporarily</strong>. Leaving your car here all day would be a mistake...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 15-5-2013(6): I&#039;m<strong> temporarily</strong> without a <em>car</em> thanks to my wife&#039;s retarded brother. I mean I feel sorry for him so I sometimes give him odd jobs to do. I asked him to give the <em>car</em> a <em>wax</em> but the jelly head gave the <em>car</em> whacks with an <em>axe</em> instead. I know. What can you do? The body shop said they would have it fixed ON <em>sun day</em> so until then I&#039;m<strong> temporarily</strong> without a car.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-2-2008(6): 暫く （しばらく） <a href="http://google.com/#q=お待ちください。">お待ちください。</a> (wait a few minutes/short while) says the japanese axe murderer after he busted your car with his axe. The next day he comes back with a new car for you. He is after all japanese and felt bad leaving you tempoarily without a car.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 11-3-2007(6): The vehicle and axe primitives are seen often together: 塹, 嶄, 慙, 慚, 斬 , 槧, 漸 and 鏨. Giving them their own identitiy, a car thats had an axe taken to it... an oldschool Mini! You&#039;re given a Mini to use for the <em>day</em> because you wrapped your 4WD around a telegraph pole thinking it could handle any terrain. Damn soccer mums. Anyway, imagine backing the Mini with all the crap you need for the day.
