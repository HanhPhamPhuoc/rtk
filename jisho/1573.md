## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-4-2007(213): To join the temple, you have to <strong>dedicate</strong> yourself to raising <em>bonsai</em> for enlightenment, and <em>cornstalks</em> for sustenance. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 23-4-2006(61): A Japanese farmer who was growing <em>corn</em> tried to<strong> dedicate</strong> himself to the god of <em>corn</em> (in the hope it would bring better harvests). He had a little room with prayer beads, incense, etc. One day he brought an offerand that he thought would please the god of <em>corn</em> : a <em>bonsai - corn</em> (a <em>corn</em> plant turned into a <em>bonsai</em>). The god was infuriated and yelled at him &quot;HOW DARE YOU TORTURE MY CORN IN SUCH WAYS!&quot;. The End. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 8-12-2008(42): I used <em>does not equal</em> for the primitve(slant the line as a slash through the &quot;equals&quot; sign). Story: Decorating a <em>bonsai tree</em> for Christmas <em>does not equal</em> an <strong>observance</strong> of the real meaning of Christmas. Just like most people who<strong> dedicate</strong> themselves to appeasing the Credit Card gods for Christmas. Just <em>dosen&#039;t equal</em> the Christmas I know of. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drivers99">drivers99</a>] 14-8-2009(34): You have to be really<strong> dedicate</strong>d to make a <em>bonsai tree</em> out of a <em>cornstalk</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 11-4-2007(16): Once a year, the Japanese decorate bonsai trees with miniature cornstalks, and<strong> dedicate</strong> them to the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan. (For the record, I completely made that up, and I don&#039;t think corn has anything to do with Ainu, except that it reminds me of natives). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 2-5-2007(10): I went to a temple in Kamakura and I noticed this kanji in the word   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/奉納">奉納</a>  　(ほうのう) inscribed beneath a pair of stone guardian dogs (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/狛犬">狛犬</a>  　こまいぬ). Someone had bought the two dogs and <strong>dedicated</strong> them to the temple (very expensive thing to do). The word   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/奉納">奉納</a>   stood out because it was written in red, which means that the person who bought the dogs is still alive. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dontpokebadgers">dontpokebadgers</a>] 16-8-2011(7): The bonzai key (キ) is dedication. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mickymay">mickymay</a>] 25-4-2012(6): I think KEY for キ is a better primitive. I cannot picture a Japanese monk planting corn! dontpokebadgers&#039; story sticks: The Key to the art of bonzai is DEDICATION. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 25-10-2008(5): This <em>bonsai</em> looks awesome, I&#039;m going to<strong> dedicate</strong> it to <em>Korn</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 27-9-2006(5): If you want to turn a <em>cornstalk</em> into a <em>bonsai cornstalk</em>, you&#039;d better be very<strong> dedicate</strong>d to the art of making bonsais...
