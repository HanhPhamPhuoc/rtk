## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa">Piitaa</a>] 29-6-2006(263): <strong>One</strong> down, 2041 to go. ;).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus">findus</a>] 11-5-2008(98): To learn this<strong> one</strong> kanji, I <a href="../2000">recommend</a> (#2000 薦) this story : <em>Bambi</em> is in a <em>cave</em>, eating a side-dish of <em>salad</em> when trying to learn the kanjis. As he succeed to learn the kanji for &quot;one&quot;, you get jealous and decide to shoot him with a <em>slingshot</em>. At this moment you hear the police coming, so you hurriedly burn all the proofs into a <em>fire</em> (so you remove the key-words <em>Bambi</em>, <em>slingshot</em> and <em>fire</em> from <em>recommend</em>). So that when the police arrives, the only remaining clue is a single horizontal bar.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 27-2-2008(93): This<strong> one</strong> is too difficult to remember. If the other Kanji are this difficult, I&#039;m giving up.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/breton">breton</a>] 10-10-2007(44): A sleeping Roman I. ;).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 29-4-2009(36): Tips for your journey:1)check the keywords (for example with saiga-jp kanji dict or jisho.org or <a href="http://dic.yahoo.co.jp">http://dic.yahoo.co.jp</a> + rikaichan). heisig messes up a lot. 2)you&#039;ll get mixed up if you use too many penis euphemisms. i try to stick with just &quot;crotch&quot; for penis. 3)try to use the right meaning of the keyword in your stories. for example 抄 &quot;extract&quot; is like an excerpt, not the verb extract.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thrillhouse">thrillhouse</a>] 18-4-2006(29): <strong>One</strong>.
