3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 12-9-2006(26): <em>Chuck Norris</em> always plays poker with his cards<strong> face-up</strong> because he can&#039;t be beat anyway.

That&#039;s his idol who he looks up to in awe, and never grows tired of looking at him (this covers both meanings Heisig mentioned).

Instead of &quot;Fragile&quot;, the <em>box</em> reads: &quot;Handle with respect and awe, leave<strong> face-up</strong>, or your blood will be drained&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HydroKirby">HydroKirby</a>] 13-3-2012(3): 卬 <a href="../21356">Unicode-0x536c</a> (#21356 卬). A <em>person</em> views a superior<strong> face-up</strong> because of the superior&#039;s <em>expensive</em> badges.
