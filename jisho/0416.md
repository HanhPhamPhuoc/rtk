## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 23-2-2008(198): Making a<strong> dike</strong> is all about arranging the <em>soil just so...</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-8-2007(73): The little Dutch boy has his finger stuck in the<strong> dike</strong>, and that&#039;s the only thing keeping his town from going under. He really really needs to go to the bathroom though, so he devises a plan to carefully add a bit of dirt - there, place individual bits in <strong>just so</strong> - there, I think it&#039;s good enough. Pull it out -----yes! Success!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 9-8-2007(44): Imagine Indiana Jones replacing a gemstone with a small bag of soil. If he doesn&#039;t weigh the soil just so, a huge<strong> dike</strong> behind the wall will break, washing him away.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 30-11-2008(38): <strong>Dike</strong>s are just so dirty.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 16-7-2007(24): The<strong> dike</strong> was very close to breaking. The people worked all <em>day</em> bringing <em>earth/soil</em> to <em>mend</em> it.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Maethelwine">Maethelwine</a>] 10-11-2008(21): Making a<strong> DIKE</strong> isn&#039;t as easy as you think! The <em>soil</em> must be piled <em>just so</em> or the sea will break through.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Susume">Susume</a>] 27-8-2009(11): In FullMetal Alchemist, Izumi made, with a clap of her hands a<strong> DIKE</strong> from the SOIL to prevent the river from flooding the town. This impressed Ed and Al JUST SO very much that they wanted to become her disciples/pupils.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rosgmact">rosgmact</a>] 21-8-2007(6): The<strong> dike</strong> was, indeed, near breaching as the flood waters rose. Banding together, as only the Japanese can do, the village community worked through to the <em>break of day</em>, heaping up <em>soil</em> to <em>mend</em> it. But they kept going, beyond what was necessary, needlessly striving to make the<strong> dike</strong> <em>&#039;just so&#039;</em>, illustrating nicely the anal perfectionism that so charms, amuses and irritates the few &#039;outsiders&#039; that they deign to allow on their <em>soil</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 26-9-2010(4): The <em>soil</em> must be arranged just so t0 make a<em><strong> dike</strong>..</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 10-6-2009(4): 堤 【つつみ】 (n) bank; embankment;<strong> dike</strong> When the dirt is piled up <a href="../v4/388">just so</a> (#388 是) around water.
