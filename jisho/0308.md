heisig: "<i>Tall children</i> <b>receive</b> more attention. <i>Tall children</i> grow up to make better wide <b>receivers</b>. Take your pick, depending on whether you prefer child psychology or American football. At any rate, be sure you have some particular <i>tall child</i> in mind, someone who really was outstanding and always attracting attention, because he or she will come in handy in the next two frames."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 22-1-2007(138): In basketball however, tall children<strong> receive</strong> all the attention. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 30-11-2007(87): <em>Tall children</em><strong> receive</strong> all the attention. They also make great<strong> receive</strong>rs in football... this kanji also means &#039;catch&#039; (therefore a football<strong> receive</strong>r is a great image). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dragonslayer131">Dragonslayer131</a>] 19-11-2009(31): Kinda weird but I remember the weird ones best: A giant MOUTH wearing a TOPHAT<strong> RECEIVE</strong>S its next victim to munch on. This time its a small CHILD whimpering under the figure on the floor, scared of what is to come. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chaze">Chaze</a>] 11-5-2010(21): A word of warning: With Heisig&#039;s story I keep associating this with &quot;attention&quot;! I use something closer tied to the word<strong> receive</strong>: Imagine a bunch of kids finding an old radio. It&#039;s antenna is broken, so the <em>tallest</em> <em>kid</em> has to hold it up, and becomes the designated <strong>receiver</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cefreddffo">cefreddffo</a>] 15-10-2009(13): Usually in yaoi couples the short guy is the one who &quot;receives&quot;. But here we see how the <strong>tall boy</strong> is <em>receiving</em> and he <em>enjoys it</em> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/享楽する">享楽する</a>  ）.　　　　　　　　RTK2:　キョウ　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/享楽主義">享楽主義</a>  　きょうらくしゅぎ(hedonism). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame">yukkuri_kame</a>] 26-6-2009(9): Terrell Owens (Notice the Top Hat and Mouth are kinda like a T.O.) is a wide<strong> RECEIVE</strong>r who is a <a href="../307">tall</a> <span class="index">(#307 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/高">高</a>)</span> big-<em>MOUTHED</em> jerk that whines like a <em>CHILD</em>. But he sure can catch and always<strong> receive</strong>s a big salary...enough to afford fancy <em>TOP HATS</em>. (thanks BigAmish). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chexxor">chexxor</a>] 23-6-2008(9): The thing this <em>child</em> <strong>received</strong> for his first birthday was a <em>top hat</em>. This <em>top hat</em> had a <em>mouth</em> so wide that the <em>child</em> could could fit his entire head into the hat. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 15-8-2008(7): The <em>tall child</em> is first to<strong> receive</strong> his acceptance letter to cram school, fatty has to catch up. (Based on Heisig&#039;s idea for <a href="../309">cram school</a> <span class="index">(#309 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/塾">塾</a>)</span>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 29-10-2007(5): [Image: children&#039;s basketball] <em>Tall kids</em><strong> receive</strong> all the attention. The following may help to contrast this kanji with <a href="../735">accept</a> <span class="index">(#735 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/受">受</a>)</span>. Receiving is generally a passive process -- for example, receiving attention. <strong>Accepting</strong> is slightly more active -- for example, <strong>accepting</strong> attention means coming to terms with <strong>receiving</strong> it.
