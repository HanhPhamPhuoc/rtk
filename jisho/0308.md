## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Themistoclaus">Themistoclaus</a>] 24-4-2011(51): <strong>Metaphor</strong>ically speaking, all the equipment in your <em>mouth</em> is basically just a <em>meeting of butchers</em>, designed to pulverize whatever meat you put in there.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 16-7-2010(18): <strong>Metaphor</strong>: A good <strong>metaphor</strong> flows from the <em>mouth</em> like the <em>meeting of flesh and saber</em>, smoothly piercing the listener with its meaning. But a bad <strong>metaphor</strong> is like when you barely nick the <em>flesh</em> and only spill <em>two drops</em> of blood or when your <em>saber</em> doesn&#039;t penetrate at all but rather bends into a くく shape when you whack the <em>flesh</em>. (Note: This story incorporates both the traditional form of the kanji ( <a href="http://google.com/#q=口＋兪">口＋兪</a> ) and the simplified form ( <a href="http://google.com/#q=口＋俞">口＋俞</a> )) .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 24-11-2009(13): <strong>Metaphor</strong>: (Let this altered butcher primitive = <em>koo-koo butcher</em>, notice the kana くく). <em>Koo-koo butcher</em>s sell even the <em>mouth</em> of an animal and support their actions with crappy <strong>metaphors</strong> such as &quot;I ain&#039;t never meat the man who doesn&#039;t like his mouth.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp">aaroncp</a>] 6-2-2011(11): A <em>meeting of butchers</em> is a perfect<strong> metaphor</strong> for the supposed secret talks(<em>mouth</em>) between Hitler and Stalin.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-11-2011(3): 喩え ( 例え ), 比喩 , 隠喩 , 暗喩 , 直喩 , <a href="../v4/3009">metaphor</a> (#3009 喩) ユ( 輸 ), たとえる, たとえ ... Parts: 口 , 兪/俞 (cf: 輸入 <a href="../v4/289">transport</a> (#289 輸), 真鍮 <a href="../v4/37742">Unicode-0x936e</a> (#37742 鍮)) ... Story: A <strong>Meat-aphor</strong> for modern times: What we put into our <em>mouths</em>, the dead flesh from a thousand <em>Koo-Koo Butchers</em>, is the cause of the that which comes out of those same mouths. We speak of nothing but death from our mouths, because we put nothing but death into our mouths.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 23-3-2010(3): <strong>metaphor</strong>. I open my <em>mouth</em> to create a <strong>metaphor</strong>, &quot;As gory as a <em>butcher&#039;s convention</em>&quot;. Note: 兪 = 俞 variant.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plasticdome">plasticdome</a>] 17-9-2012(2): The reporter opened his <em>mouth</em> at the staff <em>meeting</em> and <em>butchered</em> the<strong> metaphor</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oharawinter">oharawinter</a>] 8-7-2012(2): <strong>Metaphor</strong>s transport you with the mouth instead of a car.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 1-6-2011(2): After hearing meat-based puns (<strong>metaphors</strong>) for years and years, the butcher finally went crazy (became a <em>koo-koo butcher</em>) and started foaming at the <em>mouth</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/corey">corey</a>] 7-10-2010(2): 喻.
