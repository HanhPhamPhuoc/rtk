heisig: "When we run across abstract key words like this one, the best way to get an image it to recall some common but suggestive phrase in which the word appears. For instance, we can think of the expression &quot;it's the <b>only</b> one of its kind.&quot; Then we imagine a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pac-manlike creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic <i>mouth</i> and two wee <i>animal legs</i>."
