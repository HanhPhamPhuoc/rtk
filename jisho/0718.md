## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui">bigloui</a>] 1-5-2006(307): Oh come on people - say what we&#039;ve all been thinking: the<strong> uncle</strong> is that creepy guy towering <em>above</em> a <em>little</em> one&#039;s <em>crotch</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 28-6-2008(165): Four straight kanji here with 叔 in it, so let&#039;s make one story: Your<strong> UNCLE</strong> was full of <a href="../720">loneliness</a> (#720 寂) ( 寂 ), and he lived by himself. He was naturally <a href="../721">graceful</a> (#721 淑) ( 淑 ) in the water, and you knew he was once on the Olympic synchronized swimming team). You knew that there was something different about him, but you joined his youth team and he <em>watched</em> over you carefully as <a href="../719">coach</a> (#719 督) ( 督 ). It was uncomfortable, though, how your <a href="../718">uncle</a> (#718 叔) often touched you just <em>a little above</em> the <em>crotch</em> ( 叔 ) when coaching...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 16-6-2006(86): Imagine one of those cliches of comedy: an <strong>uncle</strong> is <em>above</em> the <em>little</em> <em>crotch</em> of the new born nephew, when the baby pees in his face!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mrred">mrred</a>] 16-7-2008(68): This kanji becomes easy if you use its proper meaning as a keyword: <strong>younger sibling of parent</strong>. Now read the character as a set of instructions to locate the <strong>younger siblings of your parents</strong> in your family tree, starting from yourself: If you go up to the row (generation) <em>above</em>, to your parents, then the <strong>younger siblings of your parents</strong> are the <em>littler</em> ones as that sprang from the same <em>crotch</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 28-4-2006(37): You don&#039;t want to know. Really.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/felicitygreen">felicitygreen</a>] 1-4-2006(19): Your<strong> uncle</strong> towers above you because you&#039;re only little, but you can still play-fight with him by punching ahead of you… right into his crotch!
