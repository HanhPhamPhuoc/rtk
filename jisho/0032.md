heisig: ""Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset..." goes the song of the Fiddler on the Roof. You can almost see the journey of the sun as it moves from one horizon (the <i>floor</i>) to its noonday heights in the sky overhead (<i>ceiling</i>) and then disappears over the other horizon - day after day, marking the <b>span</b> of our lives."
