## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 27-12-2006(239): Bonsais are grown in a house, away from the harsh<strong> reality</strong> of the real world where they wouldn&#039;t survive.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 12-12-2007(104): On this rather boring &#039;big brother&#039; type<strong> reality</strong> show, they have locked up <em>bonsai</em> inside a <em>house</em> and everyone is watching them on TV 24x7. The viewers have to vote on which bonsai shall remain in the house and which one has to leave.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 13-10-2006(27): (adapted from PepeSeco) In a new TV<strong> reality</strong> show called <em>bonsai</em> <em>house</em>, participants are challenged to grow the best bonsai. It takes years to make just one episode!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 7-6-2008(14): <em>Mr. Miyagi</em> is on a new<strong> reality</strong> TV show, <em>House of Miyagi</em>. 20 aspiring martial artists have to wash and clean an old house, while growing their own bonsai. Of course, their Bonsai don&#039;t come out very well, since they&#039;re novices. (I&#039;m trying to differentiate this bonsai from the rest of the ones we&#039;ve learned as being a messed up bonsai.. Notice the last stroke doesn&#039;t connect to the 2nd stroke of the kanji, but the 3rd instead.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 1-7-2009(12): The<strong> reality</strong> is that most <em>bonsai</em> don&#039;t do well in the <em>house</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelooseteeth">thelooseteeth</a>] 17-11-2009(4): The hip new<strong> reality</strong> TV show: &quot;<em>Bonsai House</em>&quot; details the real lives of <em>bonsai</em> hobbyists.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 27-6-2006(4): In a new TV<strong> reality</strong> show the participants have to live together in a <em>house</em> which is nothing other than a <em>bonsai</em>. You can picture how crowded it will get.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gibler">gibler</a>] 11-2-2013(3): A more simple Primitive than bonsai: <strong>3 people 三 ＋ 人 </strong> It became a<strong> reality</strong>.. I needed <strong>3 people</strong> (roommates) to replace the ones leaving or I couldn&#039;t afford to stay in this big <strong>house</strong>!! RTK2:　ジツ 事実 じじつ(fact). 実 み　－　Ｆｒｕｉｔ.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drwaltoa">drwaltoa</a>] 15-9-2011(3): Bonsai are grown to imitate<strong> reality</strong> (full-sized trees in the wild) but also to fit inside a house.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akagisempai">akagisempai</a>] 31-1-2011(3): The THREE AMIGOS have their own<strong> REALITY</strong> show in based in their lavish HOUSE. It get&#039;s really crazy when they hookup with a few girls around town.
