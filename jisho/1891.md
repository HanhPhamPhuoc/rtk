heisig: "Between the <i>top hat</i> and the <i>scarf</i> you will see the character for <i>in</i> which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the <i>scarf</i>. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the <i>in</i> (the <i>walking stick</i> in the <i>mouth</i>) was set on its side; here it is set upright."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-7-2007(267): The guy from <a href="../401">pathetic</a> <span class="index">(#401 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/哀">哀</a>)</span> shared his<strong> inmost</strong> feelings with a girl and she rammed a <em>walking stick</em> down his throat. It ruptured his<strong> inmost</strong> organs. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 4-10-2007(59): Besides making money from acting like a dog (see decline), the <em>pathetic</em> man has risked his<strong> inmost</strong> internal organs by becoming a <em>cane</em> swallower! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(45): I&#039;m going with 9 strokes: the magician pulled <em>10 scarves</em> from the <strong>inmost</strong> part of his <em>mouth</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 18-4-2008(35): <strong>Note</strong>: Incorrect stroke order and count in book. Is written <em>one</em>, <em>mouth</em>, <em>walking stick</em>, <em>scarf</em>, with 9 strokes. [It evolved from a combination of <em>garment</em> and <em>in</em> (meaning undergarments), so maybe it used to be written as described in the book...]. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 22-10-2008(11): The <em>pathetic</em> emo guy is always talking about his<strong> inmost</strong> feelings. Sometimes I want to shove a <em>walking stick</em> in his <em>mouth</em> to stop him talking. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spoonsman">spoonsman</a>] 18-2-2009(10): Japanese Wikipedia lists this as having 10 official strokes, however it says it&#039;s often written with 9. So either 9 or 10 is correct, take your pick. <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>常用漢字一覧. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 28-7-2009(5): After pinning me to the ground, that nudist homosexual from <a href="../401">pathetic</a> <span class="index">(#401 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/哀">哀</a>)</span> and <a href="../1890">decline</a> <span class="index">(#1890 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/衰">衰</a>)</span> revealed himself to be an agent of the FBI who found out that I was the true perpetrator behind the attacks on Pearl Harbour, 9/11, and a billion other fun events. &quot;BUT THAT DOESN&#039;T EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE,&quot; I protest. &quot;I DON&#039;T CARE,&quot; the waste-of-American-tax-dollars guy bellows. He sticks some random <em>walking stick</em> down my throat, it enters my<strong> inmost</strong> organs, and I die. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fleet+street">fleet+street</a>] 24-10-2011(4): My <strong>inmost</strong> feelings are deep <em>inside</em> of me, beneath my <em>garments</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thomas86">Thomas86</a>] 26-6-2011(2): The <a href="../401">pathetic</a> <span class="index">(#401 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/哀">哀</a>)</span> guy who had been in <a href="../1890">decline</a> <span class="index">(#1890 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/衰">衰</a>)</span> couldn&#039;t ignore his <strong>innermost</strong> feelings anymore- he wanted to regain some self-respect. He took the <em>walking stick</em> out of his mouth and used it to stand upright. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 19-2-2007(2): In the <em>one</em> big <em>mouth</em>, a <em>walking stick</em> is stuck down it with a <em>pink scarf</em> tied around it. The walking stick tickles the<strong> inmost</strong> parts of the human and is then pulled back out using the scarf.
