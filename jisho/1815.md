## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-3-2007(240): The <em>king</em> has eaten too much and has to get a new <em>belt</em> <strong>again</strong>. See his fat rolls hanging over? 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 14-9-2006(93): This is a <em>belt</em> with a non-adjustable <em>jeweled</em> buckle. Everytime you go back to the leathersmith telling him to move the buckle because you&#039;ve packed on a few pounds (but that this is the last time!), he says &quot;Again?!? Weren&#039;t you just here last month?&quot;. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 1-5-2008(65): (I thought this was easier to remember as king with a belt) As the king gets fatter, his belt needs to be adjusted<strong> again</strong> and<strong> again</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-7-2009(19): I <em>craft</em> <em>yen</em> to buy things<strong> again</strong> and<strong> again</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 22-3-2007(10): Have <em>jewelled belts</em> come back into fashion<strong> again</strong>? I just can&#039;t keep up with the times! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 26-9-2010(5): To prevent the <em>jewel</em> from being stolen<strong> again</strong>, he tied it down with a <em>belt</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 21-1-2010(4): <strong>Again</strong>?! The <em>king</em> has to get another <em>belt</em>? Put that slob on a diet! (Note: <em>circle/yen + craft</em> doesn&#039;t work because there is neither a horizontal stroke in the center of <em>circle/yen</em> nor in the center of <em>craft</em>. However, there is a horizontal stroke in the center of <em>king</em> which takes care of the problem). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivantolearnkanji">ivantolearnkanji</a>] 20-4-2008(4): Overlay of roman numeral &quot;I&quot; on top of <a href="../1811">circle</a> <span class="index">(#1811 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/円">円</a>)</span> = 1-yen coin. The clerk at the combini looks at you funny because you&#039;re paying for your snacks entirely with 1-yen coins<strong> again</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lukecd">lukecd</a>] 9-10-2009(3): Open up my belt and you&#039;ll get to see my family jewels<strong> again</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/beerninja">beerninja</a>] 15-8-2009(3): (+mantixen) I <em>craft</em> counterfeit <em>yen</em><strong> again</strong> and<strong> again</strong> until I have enough to pay my rent<strong> again</strong>.
