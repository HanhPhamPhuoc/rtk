## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(28): <strong>Shrimp</strong> are the only “<em>insects</em>” that I can eat in my <em>spare time</em>: anything else requires way too much willpower.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 29-8-2011(12): 蝦夷 , 蝦夷地 , <a href="../2689">shrimp</a> (#2689 蝦) えぞ, エビ ... Parts: 虫 , Hobby ( 暇 <a href="../1882">spare time</a> (#1882 暇) - 日 ) ... Tip: Many different Kanji for<strong> shrimp</strong>: 蝦 , 海老 , 鰕､蛯. This Kanji is the old name for the Ainu: Ezo 蝦夷 , and their land Ezochi 蝦夷地 (now Hokkaido). (It also has meant Frog as well.) ...<strong> Shrimp</strong> on menus and such is 海老 . Tiger Prawns ( 車海老 ), Lobster ( 伊勢海老 ).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 22-1-2010(6): Bubba&#039;s <em>hobby</em> was<strong> shrimp</strong>, and everything to do with<strong> shrimp</strong> - bioled<strong> shrimp</strong>, fried<strong> shrimp</strong>, rotten<strong> shrimp</strong> covered with <em>insects</em>... hold on a second.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 4-1-2010(3): <strong>SHRIMP</strong> are the best INSECT to have for a HOBBY: watch them grow then eat them. (For HOBBY ref Katsuo <a href="../1882">spare time</a> (#1882 暇)).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 30-10-2009(3): A<strong> shrimp</strong> is like an <em>insect</em> in many ways, kingdom Animalia, phylum Arthopoda, but the comparison breaks down at the subphylum level: have you heard of anyone whose <em>hobby</em> is displaying different kinds of<strong> shrimp</strong> in a glass case?

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 28-11-2008(2): When a<strong> shrimp</strong> is dropped on the ground, the <em>insects</em> nearby no longer have any <em>spare time</em>, they all dive on it and have a feast.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Louismi">Louismi</a>] 9-5-2011(1): <strong>Shrimp</strong>s are like marine insects that we enjoy seen as a hobby when diving. The Ainu people are said to enjoy looking at them as a hobby because somehow they remind them of themselves. (Thanks Kapalama).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 14-1-2011(1): The pervert that spies crotches from under boxes in <a href="../1882">spare time</a> (#1882 暇) almost never leaves his boxes, so he has to eat old<strong> shrimp</strong> 蝦 , <em>bugs</em>, and occasionally frogs(which this kanji apparently means sometimes). He never gets fresh<strong> shrimp</strong> 海老 that came straight from the sea.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 29-3-2010(1): In my <a href="../1882">spare time</a> (#1882 暇) 暇 I love to catch<strong> shrimp</strong> using <em>insect</em> bate. Before I know it the <em>day has gone</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(1): <strong>Shrimp</strong> make me <em>cof</em> when I find <em>insects</em> in the poop of their <em>crotch</em>.
