heisig: "Did you ever hear of the <i>turtle</i> who fell madly in love with a <i>chihuahua</i> but could not have her because their two families did not like the idea of their children intermarrying? Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the <b>status quo</b> with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 31-7-2007(161): It was <em>left</em> to the <strong>turtle</strong> to make <em>right</em> with the <strong>dog</strong> and thus maintain the <strong>status quo.</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 13-12-2006(91): A <em>turtle</em> mounting a <em>chihuahua</em> clearly disrupts the<strong> status quo</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 4-12-2007(43): After beating the hare in a race, the <em>turtle</em> is now acknowledged to be the fastest animal. But the chihuahua is challenging the<strong> status quo</strong>, demanding a new race. And look - the dog is on the right, meaning he&#039;s passed the turtle! Hope he doesn&#039;t take a nap.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(35): If you gave the sense &quot;a person&#039;s back&quot; to the primitive in <a href="../235">portent</a> (#235 兆), you can see that a <em>dog</em>, wanting to preserve its<strong> status quo</strong> among its pals, tries to bite the <em>back</em> of a poor postman.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 27-1-2009(28): The<strong> STATUS QUO</strong> was broken when the TURTLE and the DOG got married! You should have see the offspring... Dogs with shells on!!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame">yukkuri_kame</a>] 5-7-2008(14): A lifted <em>Hairy leg</em> by a <em>dog</em> means he wants to mark his property and maintain the<strong> status quo</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samchan">Samchan</a>] 9-2-2009(13): Love this one. The turtle and the dog are on top of the pops, singing the<strong> Status Quo</strong> classic Whatever You Want. The dog is the singer, so you can only see half of the turtle playing the bass.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 12-9-2007(12): The band <strong>Status Quo</strong> gave into the excesses of celebrity. Rick Parfitt had a <em>turtle</em> and a <em>chihuahua</em> for pets.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmehr">jmehr</a>] 28-9-2008(11): The <em>turtle</em> could not catch the <em>dog</em>, and the <em>dog</em> could not bite through the <em>turtle&#039;s</em> shell, so the<strong> status quo</strong> was maintained.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo">NooNoo</a>] 23-4-2008(7): I think of Ninja Turtles with this primitive, so as not to confuse with <a href="../534">tortoise</a> (#534 亀). The Ninja Turtle and his dog (sidekick?) had nothing to do but sit around. Such was the<strong> status quo</strong>. --- <strong>Note</strong>: 状況 （じょうきょう） / the state of affairs, conditions, a situation, status, circumstances. That second kanji is <a href="../145">but of course</a> (#145 況).
