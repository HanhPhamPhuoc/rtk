heisig: "To have a <b>dream</b> after going to bed is really the <i>crown</i> to a perfect <i>evening</i>. The <i>flower</i> petals over the <i>eyes</i> (instead of the &quot;sand&quot; that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant <b>dream</b> suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 13-11-2007(164): Last night&#039;s date with Miss Sweden was like a<strong> dream</strong>. She even laid <em>flowers</em> over my <em>eyes</em> to <em>crown</em> the perfect <em>evening</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 27-3-2007(59): In the movie American Beauty, Kevin Spacey liked to<strong> DREAM</strong> about his daughter&#039;s friend and have a <em>rose petal</em> fall onto his <em>eye</em> from the <em>ceiling</em>. He did this lying in his bed each <em>evening</em>. You can almost see him lying in his bed in this kanji. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 7-10-2007(58): Sweet<strong> dream</strong>s like flowers for the eye are the crown of a perfect evening. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dbooster">dbooster</a>] 16-12-2009(39): In Japan, &quot;flowers over your eyes&quot; is a metaphor for falling asleep and<strong> dream</strong>ing (just as the sandman is in the West). So we can make a little poem: <em>Flowers</em> over your <em>eyes</em>, The <em>crown</em> of a perfect <em>evening</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 18-10-2006(30): I like to think of the sideways eye as a <em>cyclops</em>, either the monster of Greek mythology or the X-Men character. The primitive reappears in <a href="../400">demolition</a> <span class="index">(#400 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/壊">壊</a>)</span> and others. So: Odysseus and his mates carefully hang magical <em>flowers</em> above the evil <em>cyclops</em>. These allow them to take the monster&#039;s <em>crown</em> and escape in the <em>evening</em>, while the monster is peacefully <strong>dreaming</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 23-6-2008(19): Suggestion: To distinguish between the vertical and horizontal versions of &quot;eye&quot; (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/目">目</a>   and 罒), call the latter &quot;cross-eyed&quot; or &quot;net&quot; (&quot;net&quot; is used in Japanese; it&#039;s pictographic). Cross-eyed/net appears in nos. 305, 400, 831-5, 1259, 1342, 1636, 2032, 2390, 2539, 2698-9, 2929. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcpike">mcpike</a>] 27-8-2009(11): As others have pointed out.. it is a <em>NET</em> not an <em>eye</em>. ----This makes me think of &quot;dream catchers&quot; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher</a> ---------- I think of this as symbolizing a<strong> dream</strong> catcher made of <em>flowers</em> to <em>net</em> my <strong>dream</strong>s by sitting above like <em>crown</em> above me in the <em>evening</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CSBarnes">CSBarnes</a>] 8-12-2008(8): What a weird<strong> dream</strong>, I had <em>flowers</em> for <em>eyes</em> and I wore a <em>crown</em> all <em>evening</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 25-9-2009(7): In A Midsummer Night&#039;s<strong> Dream</strong>, Puck was ordered to apply the juice of an enchanted <em>flower</em> to the <em>eyelids</em> of Titania, the <em>crowned</em> fairy queen, all on one<strong> dream</strong>-like <em>evening</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meganesia">meganesia</a>] 30-12-2008(5): Think of &quot;Dream-ing Beauty&quot; (to avoid confusion with sleeping beauty) Visualize the bouquet of flowers she holds, her sideways eyes (for she&#039;s lying down), her crown, and the evening that enfolds her.
