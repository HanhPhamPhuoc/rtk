## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 2-8-2006(305): Before the time of digital <strong>calculators</strong>, people used old school <strong>calculators</strong> made of <em>bamboo</em> (abacus). It&#039;s not as easy as a <strong>calculator</strong>, but you don&#039;t need any batteries either. All you need are your <em>eyes</em> and your <em>two hands</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(117): Tip : you may see this as an Abacus, which is used to<strong> calculate</strong>. This particular ancient chinese Abacus has <em>eyeballs</em> in place of beads, and its frame is made of <em>bamboo</em>. You&#039;d be amazed at how fast people can<strong> calculate</strong> with this, especially if they can use <em>both hands</em> at once to move the ... <em>eyeballs</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 13-1-2007(50): Gah! I just can&#039;t<strong> calculate</strong> this differential equation! So I take a sharp bamboo pen in each hand and jam them into my eyes out of frustration.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 17-11-2008(27): Warning: a different abacus will be used later as a primitive, see <a href="../1381">how many</a> (#1381 幾).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mbaron">mbaron</a>] 18-8-2008(27): To<strong> calculate</strong> with the <em>bamboo</em> abacus, you need a sharp <em>eye</em> and <em>both hands</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rucury">rucury</a>] 8-9-2012(14): People, please heed to stephan&#039;s <strong>WARNING</strong>: &quot;a different abacus will be used later as a primitive, see <a href="../1381">how many</a> (#1381 幾).&quot;... <strong>DO NOT USE ABACUS!</strong> Please visit <a href="../1382">mechanism</a> (#1382 機) to see people using the &quot;true&quot; abacus primitive. This will cause some confusion later on!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 18-9-2008(13): In my maths class when we couldn&#039;t<strong> calculate</strong> a problem we would close our <em>eyes</em>, hold out our <em>two hands</em>, and the teacher would whack us with a <em>bamboo cane</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shiroi-Hana">Shiroi-Hana</a>] 11-12-2009(12): To<strong> calculate</strong> <em>bamboo</em>, you just need your <em>eyes</em> and your <em>two hands</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 12-12-2007(7): Gah! I just can&#039;t<strong> calculate</strong> this differential equation! So I take a sharp <em>bamboo</em> pen in <em>both hands</em> and jam them into my <em>eyes</em> out of frustration.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rooboy">Rooboy</a>] 8-4-2009(4): Tip: you may, like I did, have trouble with this if you associate it with <em>abacus</em> which is used later on. Story: On the <em>bamboo</em> plantation the boss is trying to<strong> calculate</strong> how much bamboo each worker can carry. &quot;Now let me <em>see</em>, if a worker has <em>two hands</em> then.....&quot;.
