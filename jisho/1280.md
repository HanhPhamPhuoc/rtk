## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 11-12-2007(170): Hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> = a big <em>St. Bernard dog</em> frisking about in a <em>haystack</em>, knocking it down and spreading the hay about, after the field hands just stacked it up.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 30-10-2006(90): A<strong> bustle</strong> is also the name for the big wire-framed skirts that women used to wear. Here&#039;s a <em>St. Bernard dog</em> jammed ass-first into the top of a <em>haystack</em>, looking like some kind of proper Victorian-era lady as he struggles to get out.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 13-3-2008(73): (note: easier way to remember haystack - it&#039;s just as difficult to find a needle in a haystack, even if you use two hands) Farmers hustling and bustling to move big haystacks.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 9-3-2008(41): In the hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> of NYC, you suddenly find this humongous <em>haystack</em> and a giant <em>St. Bernard</em> sitting on top of it, howling Christmas songs. Nobody even stops to look....only in NYC.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imagia">imagia</a>] 27-8-2008(12): - I had trouble using the haystack primitive without &quot;money&quot; as in the following frames, so I&#039;ve separated the elements out to make sure I don&#039;t put &quot;money&quot; into this kanji. Whenever you come across any<strong> BUSTLE</strong>, there&#039;s a simple solution for getting through. Get your St Bernard and prick him with a needle - he&#039;ll cut right through the<strong> BUSTLE</strong>. You just have to hold onto him with two hands!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meeatcookies">meeatcookies</a>] 30-3-2012(8): Story for the haystack primitive: you&#039;re trying to find a <em>needle</em> in a haystack, with your <em>both hands</em>. For<strong> bustle</strong>: Farmers are <strong>bustling</strong> around and making a <em>big haystack</em> with the hay laying around.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxg">tritonxg</a>] 1-2-2010(6): [FR]<strong>se précipiter</strong> N1 <strong>HON</strong> k&amp;k:1659<em> st bernard+meule de foin</em> <strong>avalanche :</strong>on se PRECIPITE à la recherche des rescapés qui grâce au ST BERNARD ne sont pas une AIGUILLE dans une botte de FOIN 奔騰 【ほんとう】price jump 奔馬 【ほんば】galloping horse 奔流 【ほんりゅう】violent stream 淫奔 【いんぽん】lasciviousness 不羈奔放 【ふきほんぽう】uninhibited 出奔 【しゅっぽん】fuite 出奔者 【しゅっぽしゃ】fugitif 奔放 【ほんぽう】wild,extravagant.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 22-1-2009(4): (based on matticus) A<strong> bustle</strong> is also the name for the big wire-framed skirts that women used to wear. So you can just see a <em>big</em><strong> bustle</strong> sticking out the top of the haystack, as the woman has dived in headfirst, (presumably looking for a needle with 2 hands) and got stuck.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 15-12-2008(4): Whats all this<strong> bustle</strong> just about a <em>big</em> <em>haystack</em>? Don&#039;t you people have more interesting things to carouse about?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 29-5-2013(3): Tired of the hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> of the city? Go to the countryside. If you have never seen the<strong> bustle</strong> and fun of a country bumpkin game of find the <em>St. Bernard</em> in the <em>haystack</em> then you haven&#039;t lived my friends. Try it! (The <em>haystack</em> primitive here shows a <em>needle</em> being found and raised excitedly in the air with <em>two hands</em> by the finder. The <em>haystack</em> primitive is actually made from 3 <em>needles stacked</em> and only rarely, when no element is below, does it resemble <em>two hands</em>).
