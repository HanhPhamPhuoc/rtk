3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phate1313">phate1313</a>] 5-3-2008(52): The turkey and a St.Bernard dog are going to<strong> rob</strong> a bank. The turkey first, the dog behind him. When they approach the bank the turkey pulls out a tube of glue and says, &quot;Remember Dawg, it&#039;s a<strong> rob</strong>bery, whatever happens we gotta stick together.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson">smujohnson</a>] 17-7-2008(43): The poor <em>turkey</em> was<strong> rob</strong>bed of its virginity when the smart <em>St. Bernard Dog</em> <em>glued</em> its feet to the ground and then pounced on top of it! Disgusting? Yes... easy to forget the story and its primitive order? You decide.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 15-9-2009(30): A giant turkey just<strong> rob</strong>bed me- with a glue gun!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus">findus</a>] 8-6-2009(8): To avoid the confusion with <a href="../1451">steal</a> (#1451 盗), remember &quot;Rob by a dog&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 7-1-2008(7): <strong>Rob</strong> means to take by force, and a<strong> rob</strong>ber has no noble intentions (distinguish from burglar and steal). Imagine a convenience store <strong>rob</strong>bery. The perpetrators are the tag team of a <em>St. Bernard Dog</em>, to launch a ground attack, and a <em>turkey</em> to launch an air attack (albeit a poor one). Why are they<strong> rob</strong>bing the convenience store? Because they&#039;re drug addicts - they need some super <em>glue</em> for sniffing so that they can get high on the fumes. Low-life<strong> rob</strong>bers have such low goals.
