2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 23-7-2006(142): As I saw the most<strong> beautiful woman</strong> on Earth, a flock of <em>migrating ducks</em> passed by and let their poop fly. That just ruined the moment...

It&#039;s the true story about a girl who took in a flock of baby ducks whose parents died, and taught them how to migrate by flying an airplane over their usual migration route. I imagine this girl has become a<strong> beautiful woman</strong>, inside and out.

And they&#039;d shit everywhere. On her face, her skirt, in her eyes, just all over. Shit everywhere, I tell you.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CaLeDee">CaLeDee</a>] 22-9-2008(6): She&#039;s such a<strong> beautiful woman</strong>, that ducks migrate to her.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(5): Similar to 姫 , but you will meet this one mostly in 愛媛県 . A<strong> beautiful woman</strong> kept prisoner in a tower (think of any applicable fairy tale), looking at a flock of migrating ducks and wishing she could be free just like them.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 15-12-2009(4): &quot;Why do birds suddenly appear, every time you are near?&quot; Around this <em>woman</em> the birds that appear are <em>migraiting ducks</em> and the answer is, &quot;because she&#039;s a<strong> beautiful woman</strong>&quot;.
