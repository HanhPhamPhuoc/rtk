## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perfecturbo">perfecturbo</a>] 28-6-2006(398): Wrap your FINGERS around someone&#039;s MOUTH to keep them quiet, then put the KNIFE to their throat to ensure their cooperation. This is the best way to<strong> KIDNAP</strong> someone. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chrislewisca">chrislewisca</a>] 21-3-2007(61): After you <a href="../650">beckon</a> <span class="index">(#650 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/招">招</a>)</span> someone by seducing them, you<strong> kidnap</strong> them and hang them upside down (the reversed positions of <em>seduce</em>). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat">zwarte_kat</a>] 16-4-2007(33): <strong>Kidnap</strong>ping goes like this, after you<strong> kidnap</strong> somebody, you send one of their fingers. Then you hold a dagger before the mouth of the victim and have him talk so that people know he&#039;s still alive. This balance between cutting of fingers of the victim and having him say he&#039;s all right will make a successful<strong> kidnap</strong>ping. Join us next week on how to perform a good back-alley murder. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-4-2006(29): You<strong> kidnap</strong> someone by putting a finger on your mouth (&quot;ssh!&quot;) and a dagger under his. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonnay">jonnay</a>] 21-2-2008(13): <strong>Kidnap</strong>ping is related to, but opposite to <a href="../650">beckon</a> <span class="index">(#650 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/招">招</a>)</span>. If you beckon someone, you ask them to come to you, rather then going to them (to steal them). The kanji is an illustration of that fact, because the <a href="../11">mouth</a> <span class="index">(#11 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/口">口</a>)</span> is above the <a href="../83">sword</a> <span class="index">(#83 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/刀">刀</a>)</span>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 12-9-2008(9): Imagine a stupid<strong> kidnap</strong>per: he grabs the woman from behind and drags her, with his <em>fingers</em> in her <em>mouth</em> and a <em>dagger</em> to her throat. Not long after she bites down on his fingers and gets away. So much for that<strong> kidnap</strong>ping. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hornlo">hornlo</a>] 1-6-2011(8): [ <strong>kidnap</strong> = <em>fingers</em> + <em>mouth</em> / <em>dagger</em> ] - to <strong>kidnap</strong> someone, use your <em>fingers</em> to cover their <em>mouth</em> while holding a <em>dagger</em> at their throat; note: mouth over dagger, opposite of <a href="../86">seduce</a> <span class="index">(#86 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/召">召</a>)</span>; cf <a href="../650">beckon</a> <span class="index">(#650 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/招">招</a>)</span>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 28-1-2011(4): Easiest way to keep this separate from <a href="../650">beckon</a> <span class="index">(#650 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/招">招</a>)</span> is to note that in this case, the <em>blade</em> is -under- the mouth. In other words, the <em>fingers</em> here are holding a <em>blade</em> at someone&#039;s -throat-. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meiko452">meiko452</a>] 24-9-2010(3): All I remember were FINGERS covering my MOUTH and a DAGGER at my throat during the<strong> kidnap</strong>ping. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/faded">faded</a>] 8-12-2009(3): <strong>Kidnap</strong>ping is the opposite of beckoning.
