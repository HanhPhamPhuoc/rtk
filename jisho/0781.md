## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 4-1-2007(159): When something is <em>entered</em> by a <em>dagger</em>, it ends up being cut in several <strong>parts</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 21-3-2008(147): (This kanji also has the meanings of &quot;understand&quot; and &quot;minute&quot;). It&#039;s important to understand that were you to <em>enter</em> an hour with a <em>dagger</em> and cut it into <strong>parts</strong>, those <strong>parts</strong> would be minutes. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 28-5-2008(76): Perhaps one of the most read kanji in Japanese. It means to understand, to<strong> part</strong>, fraction, to break up, rate, minute, etc. To understand something completly one must <em>enter</em> a <em>dagger</em> into it to break it up into its <strong>part</strong>s. Imagine understanding a body by doing an autopsy(<em>enter, dagger</em>) and studying the <strong>parts</strong>.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/分かりますか？">分かりますか？</a>  . 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 30-11-2008(22): I cut the cake in to <em>eight</em><strong> part</strong>s by using a <em>dagger</em>. Then I ate one<strong> part</strong> every minute. (I just found eight easier to use than enter.). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 19-4-2010(13): Forget mnemonics for this one. Just look at it, it&#039;s a sword<strong> part</strong>ing the line above it (cutting it into two<strong> part</strong>s). Easy! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 22-7-2009(7): I wish I had chosen a different primitive for this in the long run. My suggestion to everyone is to use <strong>Wikipedia</strong> as the primitive. It&#039;s probably a very versitile primitive for stories, and works because one of the meanings of this kanji is &quot;to understand.&quot; Afterall, Wikipedia is an important <em>part</em> of the internet. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(5): A<strong> part</strong> is entered by a dagger. For<strong> part</strong> I used the image of a slice of a pie, a little way off the rest of the pie, like a portion of a pie chart. A little trap door appears at the top of the<strong> part</strong>, into which the dagger enters. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dustin_Calgary">Dustin_Calgary</a>] 23-11-2009(4): Ever hear of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;? well this is the next<strong> PART</strong>,<strong> Part</strong> 2, ENTER the DAGGER. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 6-12-2006(4): Romeo <em>enters</em> the scene and finds Juliet, whom he thinks is dead. So, he plunges a <em>dagger</em> into his chest and kills himself. <strong>Parting</strong> is such sweet sorrow! 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/somamigration">somamigration</a>] 14-10-2011(3): I divided the cake into <a href="../8">eight</a> <span class="index">(#8 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/八">八</a>)</span><strong> part</strong>s with my <a href="../83">sword</a> <span class="index">(#83 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/刀">刀</a>)</span>, it only took a minute.
