1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-12-2005(270): <strong>Marriage</strong> is the <em>day</em> in this <em>woman</em>&#039;s life where she gets a new <em>family name</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(90): Tip: Heisig later introduces the kanji   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/昏">昏</a>   <a href="../2451">dusk</a> <span class="index">(#2451 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/昏">昏</a>)</span>.

I apologize in advance for this one, ladies, but if I don&#039;t make this story memorable this kanji will haunt me forever. Ok, here goes:<strong> Marriage</strong> is the day a <em>woman</em> is changed forever. Not only does she get a new <em>family name</em> but she can start using her <em>mouth with a wagging tongue</em> to nag instead of those other unspeakable acts that her husband used to enjoy..
