2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(90): Tip: Heisig later introduces the kanji 昏 <a href="../2451">dusk</a> (#2451 昏). Story: Never enter into<strong> marriage</strong> with a <em>woman</em> at <em>dusk</em> (wait until you see them in daylight). Note: This is an ancient proverb . . . (probably).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 19-6-2008(26): My goodness, between this story and surname and matrimony.. Ouch. I apologize in advance for this one, ladies, but if I don&#039;t make this story memorable this kanji will haunt me forever. Ok, here goes:<strong> Marriage</strong> is the day a <em>woman</em> is changed forever. Not only does she get a new <em>family name</em> but she can start using her <em>mouth with a wagging tongue</em> to nag instead of those other unspeakable acts that her husband used to enjoy..
