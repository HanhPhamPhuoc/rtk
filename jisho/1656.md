## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 19-3-2006(187): Under the<strong> eaves</strong> of the house the poor family has potate plants. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 23-4-2006(84): Very good image Erik. To help those who struggleded with this, the<strong> eaves</strong> of a house is usually the bit where you hang the roof gutter along, usually made of zinc or plastic and shaped as a half-pipe. It catches rain water, so it flows to a drain pipe instead of down onto people and windows. And in this family the potato plants grow along the<strong> eaves</strong> so the water pours down on them. They are poor. so no gutter. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 9-3-2008(45): This kanji means <strong>universe</strong>, seen here as a <em>roof</em> as that was how it was represented back then the <em>vault of heaven</em>. Today, we know that seen from the <strong>universe</strong>, our planet has the aspect of a <em>potato</em>, and not a perfect sphere. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DurablePants">DurablePants</a>] 22-6-2006(34): During christmas, since your family is TOO POOR, you hang potatoes off the<strong> eaves</strong> instead of christmas lights.

Honest!&quot;. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 3-2-2008(11): An<strong> eaves</strong>dropper lurks in the<strong> eaves</strong> of your <em>house</em>, listening in on your conversation. He crouches in the low <em>potato</em> bushes to hide. But he only hears the crunching sound of you eating <em>potato</em> chips. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 5-8-2006(10): You&#039;ve heard of the &quot;couch&quot; variety in front of the TV? If he hangs from the <strong>eaves</strong>, then he&#039;s called a <em>house</em> <em>potato</em>!
