## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 14-4-2007(188): A<strong> meritorious deed</strong>? Like moving a damsel in distress out of a fire, maybe. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lunairejam">lunairejam</a>] 9-10-2007(66): Prometheus did a meritous deed for humanity by MOVING FIRE from the gods to us humans. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 4-1-2009(39): Oskar Schindler is best remembered for his<strong> meritorious deed</strong>: moving 1200 Jews to his factory so that they could be saved from the fires of Auschwitz. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 3-4-2010(33): (from Raichu) The classic<strong> meritorious deed</strong> is saving a damsel in distress from a burning building. You hear her sweet voice crying &quot;help! help!&quot; from inside. But when you get inside, you see that she&#039;s quite heavy... you&#039;ll need some muscles for this deed. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 21-1-2007(9): You get a medal if you do some <strong>meritorious deed</strong> in combat. When the shooting starts, some freeze and cannot <em>move</em>. The normal ones can move under <em>fire</em>. But the REAL medal winners are the ones that move over <em>flames</em>!. Not that is a <strong>meritorious deed</strong>! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 27-11-2008(8): I picture moving a damsel in distress out of a fire (thanks Raichu), but really focus on the fact that she&#039;s really heavy and needs all your muscles to get her out. To help recall moving, picture putting your shoulder against her and pushing her fat ass. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/henroski">henroski</a>] 6-6-2008(5): A fireman&#039;s job is to do nothing but<strong> MERITORIOUS DEED</strong>S, they MOVE FIRE from out of harm&#039;s way. Here we have a fireman rescuing &quot;little&quot;FIRES and running them down the road from a burning building to a vacant lot next door... 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-10-2005(4): An old man tells the story of how he earned a medal for<strong> meritorious deed</strong>, to a group of kids : - &quot;See, we were moving over <em>oven fire</em>... &quot; - the kids interrupt him : - &quot;You mean you were under fire?&quot; - &quot;No, no! OVER <em>OVEN FIRE</em>, will you listen to me !!&quot;. Apparently the man was part of a team that had to <em>move</em> quickly over some kind of blaze in the jungle nicknamed &quot;<em>oven fire</em>&quot;, and the sergeant kept yelling behind them &quot;<em>move</em> it - <em>move</em> it - <em>move</em> it!&quot;. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/undead_saif">undead_saif</a>] 8-9-2009(3): He MOVED the food of the OVEN FIRE, now that&#039;s a<strong> meritorious deed</strong>! he saved everybody&#039;s lunch! lol. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiVirtuoso">KanjiVirtuoso</a>] 31-10-2011(2): The fireman does the<strong> meritorious deed</strong> of <em>moving</em> the unconscious bodies away from the <em>oven fire</em>, which had been left on overnight and caught fire.
