heisig: <b>Kudzu</b>&nbsp;is a word taken over from Japanese to name the crawling vines that creep up and completely take over trees. Seeing it at its worst in the Georgia countryside makes it easy to understand why it has a reputation as the "plague of the South." From there it should not be hard to arrange the primitives, <i>flowers</i>&nbsp;and <i>siesta</i>&nbsp;into a memorable image.
