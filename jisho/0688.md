## Heisig story:

The addition of a final stroke transforms this character from the primitive for a clenched <i>fist</i> into the kanji for <b>reaching out</b>, much as a stroke of kindness can often turn anger into acceptance.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Killersquierl">Killersquierl</a>] 22-11-2007(103): I like to think of this as a <em>fist</em> with with brass knuckles because of the extra line. An old school thug <strong>reaches out</strong> to help you up but then with his other hand ( with the brass knuckles) punches you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 28-7-2008(97): <strong>Reach out</strong> and fist someone (Do you see the person primitive?).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 29-3-2007(49): I like to think of the MATRIX. Now hear me out... Remember the scene when Neo and Mr. Smith fought in the subway? there was this one part where Mr. Smith threw his <em>FIST</em> at Neo, but Neo stopped it. Mr. Smith <strong>reached out</strong> his finger (the line coming from fist) and hit Neo in the throat.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 14-10-2009(38): This is an image of the fist getting an arm (the new stroke). The FIST now <strong>reaches out</strong> farther than before.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asriel">Asriel</a>] 16-3-2009(15): Dhalism (Street Figher) can<strong> reach out</strong> his <em>fist</em> an <em>extra stroke</em> farther than anyone else, even if their <em>hands are outstretched.</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inuki">inuki</a>] 20-10-2006(12): This shows someone trying to really<strong> reach out</strong> and &quot;touch&quot; someone. It is a fist throwing a mean right hook.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wakeuplan">wakeuplan</a>] 13-8-2009(10): <strong>Reach Out</strong> is Nintendo&#039;s new casual fighting game. It&#039;s like Punch Out, but instead of using FISTS, your character fights with friendly, OUTSTRETCHED HANDS.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikin40">ikin40</a>] 15-10-2010(9): The stroke cancels out the fist of hostility, and turns into an act of reaching out to help others.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown">alatown</a>] 1-10-2009(7): When you<strong> reach out</strong> to someone, &quot;no <em>fists</em>&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 2-6-2008(5): Although Heisig says be careful not to confuse this with <a href="../462">beg</a> (#462 乞), this is too easy: Have you ever been to India? Everywhere you go, you will find <em>outstretched hands</em> <strong>reaching out</strong> to you for food or money. One day I also encountered DHALSIM there (remember SF2?), and when he &quot;reached out&quot; to me I caught his <em>fist</em> in my face.
