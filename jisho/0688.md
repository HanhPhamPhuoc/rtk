That&#039;s why I use the following story: &quot;This patient has to be <strong>watched over</strong> constantly.&quot; says the chief physician. &quot;He shouldn&#039;t use his <em>deformed hand</em> to rub his freshly operated <em>eye</em>, but he always tries to.&quot;.

This eerie creature is the head of nursing at the local hospital, while it&#039;s outward appearance is off-putting, it&#039;s medical ability is second to none. It uses it&#039;s eye-ball hands to pear through an individual straight to his ailment making a quick diagnosis. This kanji means &#039;watch over&#039; as in &#039;to take care of.&#039; 看護婦 （nurse) 看病 (nursing a patient).
