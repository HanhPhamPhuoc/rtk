## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 20-6-2006(145): <a href="../1513">land</a> (#1513 陸) Deciding to use the<strong> diamond</strong>-shaped water caltrop <em>flower</em> as cover/protection, the <em>rice-seedlings</em> with their <em>walking legs</em> (now free from soil), can start their journey.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 6-6-2008(141): Some girls want<strong> diamond</strong>s, but others will be satisfied with just <em>flowers</em>. However if you think you can win her over with <em>rice seedlings</em>, expect her to get up on her <em>walking legs</em> and walk on out!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(75): I gave her a <em>flower </em> and a <strong>diamond</strong>. We went for a walk through the <em>rice seedlings</em> after she said yes.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Drack">Drack</a>] 11-1-2011(46): Mitsubishi! In Japanese, 三菱 .. &quot;Three<strong> Diamond</strong>s&quot; .. Now look at their logo! THREE<strong> DIAMOND</strong>S. Not really a story for remembering this kanji, just wanted to share how I was just amazed by something obvious.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 29-8-2007(26): I would give that lady a<strong> diamond</strong>, if she let me plant a rice seedling in her flower between her walking legs...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 29-10-2009(22): She picked <em>flowers</em> and <em>mushrooms</em> as we <em>walked</em>. She handed them to me; I handed her a<strong> diamond</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xingji">xingji</a>] 16-10-2009(13): <strong>new primitive</strong> mushroom+walking legs= <em>hobbit</em> (because they&#039;re crazy about mushrooms and would walk miles and miles or alternately find a shortcut to the mushrooms) appears 6 times in Heisig. Bilbo our HOBBIT was looking for some MUSHROOMs under FLOWERS he found a huge<strong> DIAMOND</strong>, looked at it for a while, and put it back judging it worthless in comparison to his mithril shirt.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shank">shank</a>] 6-9-2011(10): 圥 and walking legs = <em>Toad</em>, a mushroom with walking legs. <em>Toad</em> tries so hard to earn the princess&#039; affections by giving her <em>flowers</em> and <em>diamonds</em> all the time, but he can&#039;t compete with that guy who rescues her all the time.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 26-5-2009(5): Not a real<strong> diamond</strong> but a baseball one. No proper bases so we improvise, 1st is a bunch of <em>flowers</em>, 2nd is the pile of <em>rice seedlings</em> and so on... watch the <em>running legs</em> charge around after a big hit!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 16-3-2010(4): What&#039;s the first thing that comes to my mind when I hear of <em>flowers and mushrooms</em>......Super Mario Bros! There is a new Super Mario Bros game and Nintendo invented a new powerup: a<strong> diamond</strong>. It make Mario&#039;s and Luigi&#039;s <em>legs</em> super strong and allows them to jump super long distances.
