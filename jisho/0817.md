## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SpaceCakeGirl">SpaceCakeGirl</a>] 1-1-2008(162): What a dilemna, you wore SUNGLASSES over your EYES when you went to the BIRDHOUSE so you wouldn&#039;t be recognized - but now you can&#039;t<strong> WINK</strong> at the girl you want! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 26-4-2006(158): Imagine Snoopy<strong> wink</strong>ing with his big <em>eyes</em> (and a happy smile) standing next to Woodstocks <em>Birdhouse</em>, woodstock being so cool that he wears little <em>sunglasses</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 3-2-2010(69): At the <em>whorehouse</em> a girl pulled down her <em>sunglasses</em> and<strong> wink</strong>ed at me with a <em>single massive eye</em> OMG SHE&#039;S A CYCLOPS. Didn&#039;t stop me though. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 18-1-2007(27): Out of the corner of your eye, you thought some cute girl was<strong> wink</strong>ing at you, but it turns out it was just a birdhouse with sunglasses. Isn&#039;t that always the way it turns out. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattoc_g">mattoc_g</a>] 20-4-2009(21): I prefer to use the 舛 to mean &quot;dancing legs&quot;. Makes a lot more sense to me that way. Just think of it as in the evening, you want to watch dancing legs, (you can see the two legs wrapped around a pole... right? ;) ) You go to a certain kind of &quot;BIRD&quot; HOUSE, to watch the DANCING LEGS. Your EYE is drawn to one particular set of dancing legs in the birdhouse, she has a twinkle in her eye and you blink as she<strong> WINK</strong>S at you. (This kanji also means blink and twinkle). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 29-5-2006(16): I like darg_sama&#039;s story but in order to help with the positioning of the elements, I have the whore<strong> wink</strong> over her lowered sunglasses. The passerby&#039;s <em>eyes</em> pop out as he looks back over his shoulder at her. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 18-11-2005(13): Ok, well my birdhouse is a whorehouse (&#039;bird&#039; = girl in English slang). So there&#039;s this girl sitting outside the whorehouse (I wonder what she&#039;s doing ;P), and she raises her sunglasses to show me her eyes and give me a big<strong> wink</strong> to try and get my attention. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bchallenor">bchallenor</a>] 20-9-2009(12): <em>sunglasses</em> primitive: thanks to xingji for pointing out that <em>sunglasses</em> looks a lot like タキ. I just remember them as &quot;tacky&quot; <em>sunglasses</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(8): You<strong> wink</strong> an eye at a birdhouse wearing sunglasses. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 6-3-2009(7): <strong>Wink</strong> and distinctive eyeglasses = Sarah Palin. She is at a whorehouse (not a bad metaphor for the political stage) wearing sunglasses and<strong> wink</strong>ing to anyone with their eye on her. One of the sunglass lenses is a moon, the other is squared off and has a really large pin on the side. I think Joe the Plumber made them for her.
