## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 10-2-2007(154): The shape of a Yen coin.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-1-2006(40): A poor old man is almost killing himself trying to lift a huge <em>glass hood</em> with his <em>cane</em> (using it as a lever), to get to just <em>one</em> yen coin. Note : the kanji refers to a circular, round object, but also to the Japanese currency (pronounced &quot;en&quot;).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 27-5-2007(27): A pictograph of a bank teller&#039;s window. The<strong> circle</strong>s are the coins which are passed back and forth for deposits and withdrawls.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(15): Sometimes I wear my <em>top hat</em> under my <em>hood</em> and it makes my head look like a<strong> circle</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 24-2-2008(14): You may wonder why this character is pronounced &#039;en&#039; yet is said &#039;yen&#039; in the west, well this is because when it was first romanized the obsolete ゑ character was used and as such became yen in the west.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 8-1-2010(7): Pictograph of old style &quot;saloon doors&quot;. You swing through the doors into the saloon where a group of cowboys are sitting around a <strong>circular</strong> table betting their &quot;yens&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 1-6-2009(7): This kanji is simplified from &quot;pent in . . . employee&quot;, the old writing (also read &#039;えん&#039;). <a href="midori://search?text=圓→円">圓→円</a> .

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hanamijin">hanamijin</a>] 15-6-2010(4): <strong>Circle</strong>. [Fun fact: comes from 圓, or employee in a box. Closed in a box they call office, kept there from Monday to Saturday, then with Sunday the<strong> circle</strong> is complete, only to start again. Haha.]<strong> Circle</strong> is the shape of an えん coin.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 28-9-2012(3): Just Remember It.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pradex">pradex</a>] 15-5-2013(2): <strong>YEN</strong> ist <strong>HARMONISCH</strong> und <strong>RUND</strong>.
