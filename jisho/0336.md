heisig: Here you have a perfect example of how an apparently impossible snarl of strokes becomes a snap to learn once you know its elements. The idea of being <b>admonished</b> for something already sets up a superior-inferior relationship between you and the person you are supposed to stand in <i>awe</i> of. While you are restricted to answering in honorifics, the superior can use straightforward and ordinary <i>words</i>.
