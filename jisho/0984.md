## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 4-4-2006(401): There are different<strong> cereals</strong> in different parts of the world. Japan has <em>samurai</em> cereal. Great Britain has <em>Crowned Wheat</em> ... the United States and Russia have <em>Missile</em><strong> cereals</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 4-11-2007(165): The <em>samurai crowns wheat</em> as the best <strong>cereal</strong>, and blows all others up with <em>missiles</em> (he&#039;s a <strong>cereal</strong> killer).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 29-12-2008(95): <strong>Hint</strong>: I think<strong> cereals</strong> should be studied with <a href="../710">husk</a> (#710 殻) because the difference between the husk and cereal is what&#039;s inside, would it be <em>wheat</em> or air (<em>wind</em>)! <strong>Story</strong>:<strong> cereals</strong> are similar to <a href="../710">husk</a> (#710 殻) only that the <em>husk</em>s can be carried by the <em>wind</em> because they don&#039;t have a <em>wheat</em> grain!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(23): A pack of<strong> cereals</strong> (i.e. cornflakes) contains a plastic samurai (toy) with a crown and missile (i..e a rocket launcher on its shoulder).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 20-4-2008(15): Japan has <em>samurai</em> cereal. Great Britain has <em>Crowned Wheat</em> ... the United States and Russia have <em>Missile</em><strong> cereals</strong> (hey, what do you think they keep in those silos?).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 10-5-2009(12): <em>Crowned samurais</em> ate <em>wheat<strong> cereals</strong></em> with <em>semen</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 12-6-2008(8): The samurai who was a HUSK after the advent of the missile has found a new purpose: marketing his own brand of WHEAT<strong> cereals</strong>. Note the CROWN from superfluous remains - a nod to the brand, &quot;King Wheaties&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 31-7-2009(6): The <em>samurai</em> from <a href="../710">husk</a> (#710 殻) is no longer /superfluous/. He&#039;s got a job advertising <em>crown of wheat</em><strong> cereals</strong> and doesn’t have to worry about that nasty ol&#039; <em>missile</em> anymore.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag">hunchbag</a>] 9-11-2009(5): To make the most delicious<strong> cereals</strong>, <em>samurai</em>s would <em>crown the wheat</em> with jets of their <em>semen</em>! mmmm FROSTED FLAKES!!!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 25-1-2012(4): After eating the<strong> cereals</strong> of champions, <em>wheaties</em> and not superfluous husks, he put aside his <em>missile</em> and <em>crowned</em> himself <em>samurai</em>. (compare with <a href="../710">husk</a> (#710 殻)).
