## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-2-2007(57): <em>Each</em> time I see this kanji I<strong> reprehend</strong> the <em>person</em> primitive for knocking the <em>each</em> primitive out of shape.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 24-4-2007(15): You only <strong>reprehend</strong> him because he is reprehensible! He <em>walks around</em> kicking <em>people</em>, like he wants to dispose of them. And that&#039;s all on top of having a big <em>mouth</em>. Reprehensible! Of course you must be the one to <strong>reprehend</strong> him.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-10-2008(5): You<strong> reprehend</strong> the <em>person</em> butting in and messing you up <em>each</em> time you try to write a kanji.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 7-5-2011(1): Suggested alternative keyword: nit-pick. &quot;Quick nitpicking each and every person last person you meet!&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 22-1-2011(1): Here we have a person opening their mouth and getting <strong>reprimand</strong>ed with a swift kick in the butt (top part of kanji). I like this keyword better because I know the English word much better.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 14-6-2010(1): <em>Mr. T</em> is<strong> reprehend</strong>ed for messing up the <em>each</em> primitive. &quot;I pity da foo<strong> reprehend</strong>s me for messin&#039; up the each primitive!&quot; says Mr. T.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/libsrone">libsrone</a>] 30-1-2010(1): Don&#039;t even try to<strong> reprehend</strong> Mr T - not unless you want your mouth walked on.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 9-7-2009(1): Some people<strong> reprehend</strong> people with their <em>mouths</em>, <em>Mr.T</em> however kicks people in the nuts with his <em>walking legs</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nmacneil">nmacneil</a>] 18-2-2013(): A person who can&#039;t walk the walk with his walking legs, but loves to talk the talk with his mouth, should be<strong> reprehend</strong>ed. Note: this person obviously isn&#039;t Mr. T, because he would never do such a reprehensible thing!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikkol">mikkol</a>] 18-11-2012(): I changed the keyword to fault-finding. In her case fault-finding is easy. She always spreads her walking legs (spreaded stroke) to every person and goes down with her mouth too.
