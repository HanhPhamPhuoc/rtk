heisig: "The key word connotes the preliminary composition of a plan or manuscript. Its elements: <i>wheat</i> . . . <i>tall</i>. wheat This primitive element will be made to stand for wheat. It connotes a special grain, more expensive than ordinary rice and so reserved for special occasions. Alternatively, it can mean cereal. Its form is like that for tree, except for the dot at the top to represent a spike of wheat blowing in the wind. [5]"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-3-2007(235): Aliens often<strong> draft</strong> their plans for invasion by cutting designs among the <em>tall</em> <em>wheat</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 2-10-2007(220): The first<strong> DRAFT</strong> of catcher in the rye was actually called &quot;catcher in the TALL WHEAT&quot;...good thing they changed it. I read it in 高校 .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 5-4-2008(85): <strong>Draft</strong> <em>wheat</em> beer (Hefeweizen) is served in the typical <em>tall</em> German glass.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 9-9-2007(43): They tried to<strong> draft</strong> a plan to make the <em>wheat</em> grow <em>tall</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 11-6-2009(20): The writer hid himself in the middle of <em>tall wheat</em> so he would not be disturbed while writing the<strong> draft</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 11-11-2007(15): Aliens (the ones from the Heisig mnemonic for <em>tall</em>) often<strong> draft</strong> their plans for invasion by cutting designs among the <em>wheat</em>. This way, people will think it&#039;s just a <em>tall</em> tale, like they did in Signs. (thanks, decamerØn).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bluestocking">bluestocking</a>] 19-12-2007(11): For writers, a<strong> DRAFT</strong> of a manuscript ( 稿本 [こうほん]) is like TALL WHEAT for farmers: the fruition of hard work. Only a year for farmers--much longer for most writers! 稿 [こう] manuscript, version; 稿本 [こうほん]; 稿人 [こうじん] straw figure; 稿料 [こうりょう] advance for manuscript, copy-money; 稿を改める [こうをあらためる] (exp) to rewrite a manuscript.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yuta73">Yuta73</a>] 13-4-2013(10): Don&#039;t use <strong>draft</strong>, it can be easily confused with 描 <a href="../v4/670">sketch</a> (#670 描) and 画 <a href="../v4/1170">brush stroke</a> (#1170 画). Besides, <strong>manuscript</strong> fits way better its core meaning. Story: [Tzadeck] I just finished the <strong>manuscript</strong> of my thesis. Already the <em>wheat</em> outside has grown <em>tall</em>, and I&#039;m only done with my <strong>manuscript</strong>!?. I&#039;m screwed!.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atylmo">atylmo</a>] 27-9-2008(8): <strong>Draft</strong> beer - made using only the <em>high</em>est quality <em>wheat</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 4-5-2009(7): I just finished the<strong> draft</strong> of my thesis. Already the <em>wheat</em> outside has grown <em>tall</em>, and I&#039;m only done with my<strong> draft</strong>!? I&#039;m screwed!
