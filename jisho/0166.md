You might think instead of the cosmic wisdom that <b>inlaid</b> the <i>truth</i> of the universe in the stuff of the earth."

You might think instead of the cosmic wisdom that <b>inlaid</b> the <i>truth</i> of the universe in the stuff of the earth.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 9-4-2007(63): In a hole in the <em>ground</em>, the body of the victim was placed. And then the killer <strong>stuffed it up</strong> so that the <em>truth</em> would not be found out, he hoped.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ragnarocko">Ragnarocko</a>] 22-7-2008(26): I stuffed up his mouth with dirt to keep the truth from coming out.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 11-7-2009(16): There is no <em>ground</em>s for what you are saying. It&#039;s not <em>true</em>. You&#039;re just making <strong>stuff up</strong>. I ought to <strong>stuff up</strong> your mouth to make you STFU.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 12-11-2012(11): The <em>ground</em> appeared <strong>stuffed up</strong> with with random deposits, or was it <strong>inlaid</strong> with the <em>truth</em> of the universe?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 6-11-2011(9): I STUFFED DIRT into his mouth to keep the TRUTH from coming to out.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 10-7-2008(7): This kanji made me think that TRUTH needed a physical image, so I&#039;ll use the generic photo of JESUS (known for the quote &quot;I am the Truth and the Light&quot; I think). Anyway, there was not enough SOIL to cover up JESUS, so he was STUFF&#039;d UP inside a hole for three days or so.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sodajerk">sodajerk</a>] 15-7-2012(4): For a geologist, inlayed right in the <em>ground</em> is the <em>truth</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 27-8-2010(4): For the inlay keyword in the new supplement, think of someone finding up a very difficult riddle inlayed on soil, and trying to figure out its truth.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 27-6-2009(3): If what you are saying is not <em>ground</em>ed (er, &quot;<em>soil</em>ed&quot;) in the <em>truth</em>, you&#039;re just making<strong> stuff up</strong>! And if that&#039;s the case, you <em>truthfully</em> can take it and <strong>stuff it up</strong> the place you <em>soil</em> yourself from!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jameswa">Jameswa</a>] 9-3-2013(2): In the <em>soil</em>, we inlay the <em>truth</em>.
