## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 2-12-2008(58): There is a certain restaurant in West-Shinjuku that serves its<strong> noodles</strong> made of BARLEY in a MASK instead of a plate. I love these theme-restaurants!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 9-6-2008(18): Don&#039;t be fooled! That&#039;s just <em>barley masq</em>uerading as<strong> noodles</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 22-10-2010(5): 素麺 , 老麺 , 麺 (麵)<a href="../v4/2752">noodles</a> (#2752 麺) メン ... Parts: 麦 , 面 ... The most common use for this, Ramen, is actually written in Kana exclusively. The Kanji is used to talk about the<strong> noodles</strong> themselves before they are cooked into a dish. ... Story: How did <em>Chris Barley</em> get so fat? He lived near an all-you-can-eat <strong>Noodle</strong> shop (Ramen, Somen, etc.). Even after they banned him, he would just put on a mask and keep coming back. Richard Nixon mask? Check. Tony Blair Mask? No good, that mouth is too small.
