## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 25-6-2006(182): <a href="../v4/1513">land</a> (#1513 陸) The <em>rice-seedlings still stuck in the soil</em> gather <em>round</em> in a circle. Their combined <em>power</em><strong> forces</strong> them out of the ground at last.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelooseteeth">thelooseteeth</a>] 17-10-2009(42): <em>Mushroom</em>...<em>Fat man</em>....= <em>Mario</em>. <em>Mario</em> jumps on top of Bowser&#039;s<strong> forces</strong>, crushing their evil <em>power</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 28-7-2006(37): The <em>fat</em> sumo-farmer<strong> forces</strong> <em>rice seedlings</em> into the <em>ground</em> with his huge <em>muscles</em>. With his combination of mass and strength, it&#039;s not suprising very few of the seedlings survive and he is <strong>forced</strong> to diet.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 19-11-2006(24): Looks like a physics formula to me: rate of time (rate of growth of <em>rice seedlings</em>) over the rate of (<em>ground</em>) distance <em>round</em>ed and multiplied by <em>power</em> gives you <strong>forces</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 5-1-2012(20): <strong>Halfway</strong> the journey of 3030 kanji (both Heisig 一 &amp; 三 ), you watch the long road that lies ahead of you, and you start to feel down and overwhelmed... like if you were being swallowed by <em>quicksand - grounds</em>... but you soon realize that if you made it this far, you can keep going and eventually finish! You <em>round</em> up all the will-<em>force</em> UNDER your control, and get out of this rut! And just like you, our<strong> FORCES</strong> combined will let us finish this journey! <strong>Let&#039;s go users!!</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rooboy">Rooboy</a>] 16-3-2009(18): The<strong> forces</strong> of nature need to be just right for the rice seedlings in the ground to become fat and strong.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 15-6-2010(10): <em>Mario</em> may be a <em>fat man</em> in the <em>Mushroom Kingdom</em>, but he&#039;s actually pretty small and has to use the<strong> forces</strong> of gravity to defeat the pure <em>muscle</em> power of his enemies. You can see that that <em>muscle</em> power being flattened here.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nijuro">Nijuro</a>] 20-7-2010(8): If you count the first book (2042), the third book (965), and the recently release supplement <em>to</em> the first book (23), then you have 3030 Heisig kanji in total which makes this frame the true half-way point in your journey through <em>Remembering the Kanji</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 12-11-2007(8): FRODO of the SOIL is still FAT from life in the shire, so he joins<strong> FORCES</strong> with the fellowship of people (ok ROUND it upto 10). The POWER of these<strong> FORCES</strong> may be enough to match Sauron. (With<strong> Forces</strong>, then Power element should come to mind).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 26-7-2009(7): Some mystical force has created a fairy ring, a group of <em>mushrooms</em> on the <em>ground</em> growing in a <em>round</em> circle. Step in the center &amp; feel the <em>power</em>.
