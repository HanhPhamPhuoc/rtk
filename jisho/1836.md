## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 1-5-2008(196): I was retreating from the battlefield. In the chaos, my friend threw his dogtags at me to give to his family. I managed to<strong> catch</strong> them with my fingers as the chopper was lifting off.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 20-8-2007(84): <em>Dog tag</em>: This is a wild animal track device. It has an <em>arrowhead</em> and <em>screwdriver</em>-shaped radio beacon. It&#039;s evidently fired in animals to track their movements. When animal has a <em>dog tag</em>, it&#039;s easy to <strong>catch</strong> it: just take a <em>dog tag</em> in your <em>fingers</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(52): &quot;Dog tag&quot; appears later as a kanji on its own: <a href="../2097">offspring</a> (#2097 甫) Offspring are pretty slippery when they come out of the womb; be sure to<strong> catch</strong> the baby with your fingers so it doesn&#039;t slide and fall on the floor!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 9-4-2007(23): In some countries when they<strong> catch</strong> a thief, they cut his fingers and put a sturdy RFID dog tag on him. (I made this all up of course).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Joyo1945">Joyo1945</a>] 11-6-2009(16): Its easy to<strong> catch</strong> a dog if it has <em>dog tags</em> because you can just use your <em>fingers</em> to take it by the collar.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 17-7-2008(15): After I FINGERED the dog, the police tried to<strong> catch</strong> me. I asked them, how they found out and they answered, well, you still have that DOG TAG around your FINGER. Damn it!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 1-12-2005(14): Tip : for <em>dogtag</em> I pictured a dogtag for the Japanese robot dog &quot;Aibo&quot;. This dogtag contains a miniature <em>screwdriver</em> which can help fix Aibo. As for the upper primitive, I never figured out what Heisig meant with the <em>arrowhead</em>, so instead I use the primitive of an <em>arrow</em>, since this is basically the <em>arrow</em> with the second stroke straightened out vertically.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iAurora">iAurora</a>] 23-1-2010(10): Note: Primitive: <a href="http://www.surplusandoutdoors.com/images/product/main/DOG-TAG-TOOL-TU30.jpg">http://www.surplusandoutdoors.com/images/product/main/DOG-TAG-TOOL-TU30.jpg</a> This dogtag is not just an inditification tool, it&#039;s something you can utilize. There is a small screwdriver in it and also arrowhead sharpener - very useful at war.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(5): <em>Fingers</em> try to<strong> catch</strong> a runaway <em>Segway</em> scooter (like a <em>pogo stick</em> but <em>ten</em> times better if you can <em>drop</em> the bones for one).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 26-3-2008(4): For the right primitive I have chosen to use the Male Symbol &quot;♂&quot; as it&#039;s a moon + arrow. You<strong> catch</strong> a thief by grabbing his <em>male symbol</em> with your <em>fingers</em>. Don&#039;t move, or else...!!!
