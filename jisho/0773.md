## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 24-10-2006(215): Heisig mentions at kanjiclinic.com that he wishes he&#039;d chosen <strong>mountain pass</strong> for this keyword as it&#039;s closer to what the word means. If we do this, the kanji makes complete sense because a <strong>mountain pass</strong> is just <em>below</em> the <em>mountain</em> <em>top</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 22-1-2006(76): To the north of Lorien lies the Misty Mountains, and below their towering peaks are the Mines of Moria. The Fellowship of the Ring first tried for the<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong> that goes above, but were halted by the wizardry of Saruman at Caradhras, and so are forced to take the<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong> that goes below, through the mountain - a path long feared by Gandalf for the ancient evil that lurks there. Note : the kanji does in fact refer to a &quot;mountain pass&quot;. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 5-12-2006(31): The place on the <em>mountain</em> where you stand <em>above</em> and look <em>down</em> upon all creation is the mountain peak. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 10-4-2008(24): You&#039;re stuck. You look <em>up</em> and see only <em>mountain</em>. You look <em>down</em> and see only <em>mountain</em>. How the hell do you get out of here? Oh, there&#039;s a<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong>. Thank God! 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Izumo">Izumo</a>] 31-3-2010(19): The<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong> helps you go <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> the <em>mountain</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 18-3-2008(10): At the <em>mountain</em> pass, there is <em>up</em> one way, and <em>down</em> the other: you choose the direction to continue in. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nisshawn">Nisshawn</a>] 10-9-2009(9): INITIAL D! This kanji means とうげtouge so car people will know, basically there are many <em>touge battles</em> in Japan where cars race up and down a section of the mountain to see if they can catch each other. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 29-11-2009(5): The<strong> mountain pass</strong> is the point where the way <em>up</em> becomes the way <em>down</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 20-2-2008(5): Think of the Fellowship of the Ring taking the<strong> mountain pass</strong>, first above, then below, through Moria. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fvenegas">fvenegas</a>] 2-4-2012(4): The<strong> mountain pass</strong> is a perfect place to stand and admire the sky <em>above</em> and the valleys <em>below</em>.
