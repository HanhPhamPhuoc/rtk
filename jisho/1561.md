heisig: This character, used for everything from little <b>humps</b> of hills to camel <b>humps</b>, easily suggests the hunch on the pig's back and hind parts where the best cuts of meat are to be found (and hence the English expression for luxury, "living high off the hog.") The elements we have to work with are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i> . . . <i>cell</i>.
