## Heisig story:

Line . . . run.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deborah">Deborah</a>] 28-11-2007(160): The<strong> junior</strong> employee is always <em>RUNNING</em> around <em>GOING</em> here and there for his superiors.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 28-9-2006(58): Your<strong> junior</strong> or Jr. in the succession <em>line</em> is the one who <em>run</em>s after you.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988">pageturner1988</a>] 18-12-2007(36): I&#039;m not sure where Heisig gets the<strong> junior</strong> keyword, but this kanji is more often used in the sense of either futile (e.g. 徒労 - fruitless efforts) or group(gang) member (e.g. 聖徒 - disciple, キリスト教徒 - Christian). I&#039;ll use gang member for this one. The<strong> junior</strong> <strong>gang member</strong> is going to represent at the running competition.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 22-8-2007(18): Little <em>The Flash</em> <strong>junior</strong> likes to <em>run</em> around in his red undies. But he&#039;s nowhere near as fast as his dad.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 18-2-2006(16): Spartan soldiers raised their <em>junior</em> boys strictly, one of the tests forcing them to <em>run</em> around their impressive <em>columns</em> untill the<strong> junior</strong>s fell to the ground, exhausted and dizzy to the state of nausea.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kansaigaijin">kansaigaijin</a>] 8-3-2009(14): In the Roman army, the <em>column</em> of <strong>junior</strong> soliders had to <em>run</em> ahead of the veterans and be the fodder for the initial assault. Charge!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(8): Not many people konw this, but when <em>Lance Armstrong</em> was a<strong> junior</strong> in high school, he was a championship <em>run</em>ner. He actually despised bikes. Then, after realizing that shaving your legs is only okay for bicyclers, he decided to pick up bicycling. Or, think of <em>Lance Armstrong</em><strong> Junior</strong>, who is still athletically inclined but doesn&#039;t want to follow in his father&#039;s footsteps - so he decides to <em>run</em> instead.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Teskal">Teskal</a>] 2-4-2009(7): German: Vor den Konzert war eine riesen <em>Menschenschlange (Kolonne)</em>, das ich dorthin ge<em>laufen</em> bin, war <strong>vergeblich</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/isharabash">isharabash</a>] 3-10-2009(5): Wherever you <strong>go</strong> your <strong>junior</strong> runs after you...
