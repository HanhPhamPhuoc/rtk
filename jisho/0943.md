## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 14-5-2007(182): <em>Bamboo</em> is the best material from which to make a <em>brush</em> if you want it to be a<strong> writing brush</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-7-2008(57): Traditionally, the ふで, or<strong> writing brush</strong>, was made with a <em>bamboo</em> handle and the hair of an animal (usually horse, rabbit, or wolf). Before the advent of paper (which the Chinese invented), writing was also done on segments of bamboo. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 3-1-2010(11): When the <em>panda</em> held the magical<strong> writing brush</strong>, he was able to draw every Heisig kanji without having even studied the book. Picture yourself studying for months and the panda picks up the<strong> writing brush</strong> and does better than you. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 7-4-2008(7): For <em>bamboo</em>, I visualise <em>panda</em>. The first writing <em>brushes</em> were of an enormous size, because there was no ink as yet and scribes had to write by poking <em>pandas</em> in the backside and writing with panda manure. (<em>Ancient Chinese legend explaining why pandas are so shy and retiring</em>). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-4-2006(6): My<strong> writing brush</strong> is a “bamboo brush”, my handwriting is both supple and tense, like the bamboo. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/unicornpuddlefoot">unicornpuddlefoot</a>] 6-12-2008(4): <em>Bamboo</em> would make an excellent<strong> writing brush</strong> as the ink could flow through the hollow center like an ink pen... 　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　ヒツ　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/鉛筆">鉛筆</a>  　えんぴつ(lead pencil). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hellk">hellk</a>] 12-9-2012(3): My<strong> writing brush</strong> is made of bamboo. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/catJapan">catJapan</a>] 17-8-2012(2): This <em>brush</em> is for a very specific purpose; it&#039;s a <em>bamboo</em><strong> writing brush</strong>. You can only use it to write about <em>bamboo</em>. If you try to use it for anything else, you will soon be writing about <em>bamboo</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 8-4-2009(2): <em>bamboo</em> <em>writing brush</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 21-1-2008(2): Paul Bunyan is in Asia and wants to write a letter home to Babe the Blue Ox. He grabs some <em>bamboo</em> stalks, <em>brushes</em> off the dirt, dips them in ink, and starts off about his travels with his new<strong> writing brush</strong>.
