## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 19-2-2007(117): Mr. T is very<strong> partial</strong> to hentai comic books. I know because he dropped a pile of them when I accidentally bumped into him at the door to kinokuniya! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 25-12-2007(88): <em>Mr. T</em> is <strong>partial</strong> to <em>konbini hentai</em>. He reads them for hours every day after work at his local konbini. (Primitive: <em>KONBINI HENTAI</em>, all the magazines(scrapbooks) by every konbini door in Japan). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-1-2007(45): Comic book is a nice idea. It&#039;s a sort of scrapbook that is like a door to a different kind of reality. Person is always<strong> partial</strong> (unfair) on the subject of comic books, because (s)he doesn&#039;t like them. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 16-12-2008(38): Right side: scrapbook on your door = <em>Heisig kanji poster</em>. Story: A <em>person</em> with a <em>Heisig kanji poster</em> is<strong> partial</strong> to the Heisig method. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 3-3-2008(29): This reminds me of those<strong> PARTIAL</strong>/BIASED religious PEOPLE who come to your DOOR trying to shove the biblical SCRAPBOOK down your throat. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 25-2-2010(23): 扁: <em>Door</em> and <em>scrapbook</em> combine to mean &quot;<strong>flat</strong>&quot; (<a href="../25153">Unicode-0x6241</a> <span class="index">(#25153 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/扁">扁</a>)</span>, 扁), a fairly uncommon kanji (though common in Chinese) but useful primitive. See my notes there. <strong>Comic book</strong> or better <strong>hentai</strong> (as a mnemo for the on&#039;yomi HEN) seem like vivid primitive meanings for 扁. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 8-1-2010(12): 扁 - according to Henshall, the primary meaning of this primitive was &quot;doorsign&quot;, which gave the idea of &quot;one-side of smth.&quot; (as well as flat, small etc.). Hence the meaning of this kanji, i.e. &quot;one-sided person&quot;. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain+Kanjipants">Captain+Kanjipants</a>] 17-3-2010(7): Right side: kanji scrapbook on your door = <em>Heisig kanji poster</em>. <em>Mr T</em> is<strong> partial</strong> to the Heisig method so he bought one of those <em>Heisig kanji posters</em> with the mouse on it to hang on his <em>door</em>. (Thanks, theasianpleaser). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 14-5-2008(7): Mr. T keeps a <strong>scrapbook</strong> of all the A-Team highlights he&#039;s<strong> partial</strong> to on his dressing room <strong>door</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 31-1-2010(6): Suggestion: New primitive, let 扁 (door + scrapbook) = <em>graffiti</em>, i.e. using a <em>door</em> like it&#039;s a <em>scrapbook</em>. Also appears in <a href="../1824">everywhere</a> <span class="index">(#1824 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/遍">遍</a>)</span>, <a href="../1825">compilation</a> <span class="index">(#1825 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/編">編</a>)</span>, <a href="../2645">livraison</a> <span class="index">(#2645 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/篇">篇</a>)</span>, <a href="../2806">cheat</a> <span class="index">(#2806 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/騙">騙</a>)</span>. Story: <em>Mr. T</em> is so<strong> partial</strong> to <em>graffiti</em> that he even lets you write some on him.
