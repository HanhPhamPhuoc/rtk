## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-7-2007(220): &quot;Goodness<strong> gracious</strong>! Such an <strong>elegant</strong> <em>turkey with a tusk</em>.&quot; This mnemonic is meant to join RtK&#039;s keyword with a better proposition. Heisig could have used &quot;<strong>elegant</strong>&quot; here, which is not confounded so easily with <a href="../v4/721">graceful</a> (#721 淑), and accurately represents the character&#039;s meaning (it is also the chosen keyword in Kodansha&#039;s Kanji Learner&#039;s Dictionary).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 5-4-2007(47): To not confuse it with <a href="../v4/606">grace</a> (#606 恩) or <a href="../v4/721">graceful</a> (#721 淑), think of the phrase &quot;Goodness<strong> gracious</strong>.&quot; Like: &quot;Goodness<strong> gracious</strong>! A <em>turkey</em> with <em>tusks</em>!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 13-2-2007(16): Be<strong> gracious</strong> around the large-<em>tusked turkey</em>. They&#039;re emotional at the best of times, so don&#039;t excite them with a big weapon like that.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(8): WARNING: there&#039;s a kanji for <a href="../v4/1976">elephant</a> (#1976 象). ................................ <em>Elephant Tusks</em> are very <strong>gracious</strong>; <em>Turkey wattles</em> aren&#039;t. .................. <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=turkey">http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=turkey</a>+wattles .

He grabs a piece of the <em>turkey</em> ,shoves it in his mouth , runs over to the piano and starts banging on the <em>ivory (tusks) keys</em> and sings <em>Goodness</em><strong> Gracious</strong> <em>Great balls of Fire!</em>. (idea inspired by Zactacular).

They are called battle turkeys, and they have tusks coming out of their sides facing forwards as a weapon. BBC has some footage of their<strong> gracious</strong> battle movements, charging at each other to exert dominance. They do it in such an <strong>elegant</strong> fashion.
