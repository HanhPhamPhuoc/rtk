## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 15-8-2007(322): When a man<strong> PROPOSE</strong>S to a lady, he takes her FINGER and places the ring on it JUST SO, and the moment sweeps her away. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 23-4-2008(87): I tried to<strong> propose</strong> to my girlfriend, but the ring was too small to fit her <em>finger</em>. Instead of saying yes, she just uttered an annoyed sigh. So I rushed to the jeweler where he made it bigger. But now it was too big, so I rushed back to make it smaller. This spiel kept going on until the ring was finally <em>just so</em>. Her eyes lit up and she said yes. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-2-2007(38): When you<strong> propose</strong>, the ring you place on your fiance&#039;s <em>finger</em> better be <em>just so</em> (style/size/placement/etc.) or she&#039;ll reject your sorry ass. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zoletype">zoletype</a>] 3-8-2009(33): Business proposals in Japan have to be set out just so. If you fail to lay them out in the correct way, you have to give up a finger, just like the yakuza. <em>NOTE</em> This is not the same type of<strong> propose</strong> as to<strong> propose</strong> for marriage, so I opted for a different direction. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/.David">.David</a>] 23-5-2011(14): You raise your <em>finger</em> at a meeting, to<strong> propose</strong> things to be done <em>just so</em>. <em>NOTE</em> This is not the same &quot;propose&quot; as to &quot;propose for marriage&quot;. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Texie">Texie</a>] 4-8-2008(14): When you<strong> propose</strong>, you have to buy a big ring and put it on her <em>finger</em> <em>just so</em> she will marry you. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 21-11-2006(10): When you&#039;re proposing something, you have to point out (with your fingers) that it must be just so as you<strong> propose</strong>, or others will change a thing here and a thing there and mess it all up. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delenir">delenir</a>] 7-12-2009(7): They <strong>proposed</strong> a business deal, &quot;But it must be <em>just so</em>,&quot; said the one in charge, as he pointed to the plans with his <em>finger</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Melamelachan">Melamelachan</a>] 6-12-2009(7): A friend of mine once had a picnic with his girlfriend. She played around with the sandwich wrapping, putting it around her finger. After the picnic, he secretly kept the wrapping so that he could have a ring made <em>just so</em> it fit her <em>finger</em> in order to<strong> propose</strong> to her. (True story, actually!). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennyb">bennyb</a>] 10-9-2009(6): Hint: be careful; even though most of the stories are &quot;marriage proposal&quot;-related, this kanji is NOT used for that kind of language. (so as to avoid confusion with later marriage/engagement-related kanji).
