## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 19-7-2007(279): I was EMPLOYED to give HEAD...when I<strong> look back</strong>, maybe that was not a wise career move.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 20-12-2007(70): It&#039;s sad to see the <em>turkeys</em><strong> look back</strong> one last time before entering the <em>door</em> of the slaughterhouse and losing their <em>heads</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 15-1-2009(33): Think &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. Chihiro is told not to<strong> LOOK BACK</strong> at the magical bathhouse, else she will revert to the EMPLOY of the witch with an enormous HEAD.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 14-5-2008(8): When I<strong> look back</strong>, we probably shouldn&#039;t have <em>employed</em> every turkey who walked in the door. But I don&#039;t regret hiring the girls who give <em>head</em>. They make business meetings so much better..

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/einahpets">einahpets</a>] 16-1-2012(7): When I<strong> look back</strong>, I wonder what we were thinking when we <em>employed</em> that <em>turkey</em>? I don&#039;t think any of us were using our <em>heads</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/robuta23">robuta23</a>] 20-4-2011(7): The dissapointed un<em>employed</em> turkey from <a href="../1083">employ</a> (#1083 雇) <strong>looks back</strong> one last time, but the manager just shakes his <em>head</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 9-10-2009(4): Your business now completely bankrupt, you<strong> look back</strong> and think <em>employing</em> that man as <em>head</em> may not have been the best idea...
