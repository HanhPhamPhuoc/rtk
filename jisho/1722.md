2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 29-1-2008(30): Note : the meaning is in the positive sense, to cultivate one&#039;s character or interests. To work to make yourself or something better.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 2-8-2007(24): You may not have known it, but Mr. T is into discispline. Not just self<strong> discipline</strong>, in order to get into shape, but what he really likes is when the Task master spanks him with her walking stick. Don&#039;t tell Mr. T I told you. I pity da fool, and da fool would be me!!!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 5-2-2008(17): Compare with <a href="../958">permanence/remote</a> (#958 悠). <em>Mr. T</em> went to visit his old <em>taskmaster</em> who had a <em>walking stick</em>. Halfway on the way to that remote region, <em>Mr. T</em> was about to give up because of the long and difficult journey when he ran into <em>Bruce Lee</em>, who told him that<strong> discipline</strong> is needed to reach your goal.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 13-2-2009(13): <em>Mr. T</em> joins the X-men. When they catch <em>mystique</em>, he beats her with a <em>walking stick</em> like a true <em>taskmaster</em> to<strong> discipline</strong> her. But it turns out mystique has taken the shape of the walking stick, and she then beats him.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 18-12-2010(12): A <em>Jedi knight</em> learns self-discipline from Yoda - a <em>taskmaster</em> with a <em>walking stick</em> - as well as to keep him or herself in <em>shape</em>. 研修 けんしゅう training, induction; 修理 しゅうり repair, mending, servicing; 修了 しゅうりょう completion (of a course).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 15-6-2009(11): Mr T and his <em>remote taskmaster</em> (see <a href="../958">permanence/remote</a> (#958 悠)) are working together to <em>shape</em> my character and<strong> discipline</strong> me.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaggadelyc">shaggadelyc</a>] 5-3-2011(5): (dilhutenosa) Hitler wants to have Mr T in his army to teach his soldiers some<strong> discipline</strong> (yeah weird) but he wouldn&#039;t want to, so Adolf formed a Mr T Play-Doh copy of him. Because it was falling over all the time, he gave the Play-Doh figurine a walkin stick.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thomasritz">thomasritz</a>] 29-8-2009(5): <em>Mr. T</em> muss <strong>sich beherrschen</strong>, mit seinem <em>Spazierstock</em> den <em>Zuchtmeister</em> nicht zu <em>Play-doh</em> zu formen.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 11-10-2012(4): <em>Khatzumoto</em> says that although tradition dictates that people get <strong>discipline</strong> by picturing the <em>shape of the taskmaster holding a cane</em> in their minds, true <strong>mastery</strong> comes from learning to split things up into small, winnable games - then<strong> discipline</strong> becomes trivial.
