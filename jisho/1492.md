heisig: "The single stroke added to the beginning of the primitive for <i>thread</i> gives the image of threads woven into a single cord. Hence the meaning, <b>lineage</b>. As a primitive, we shall give this kanji the meaning of yarn, as the uniting of many threads into a single strand is most obvious with yarn."
