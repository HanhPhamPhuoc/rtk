heisig: This character is so logical that one is tempted to let the elements speak for themselves: <i>water</i> . . . <i>before</i>. But we have already decided we will not allow such rationalism to creep into our stories. Not even this once. Instead, let us change the character from the Peanuts comic strip called "Pigpen," who is always preceded by a little cloud of dust and grime, and rename him "<b>Wash</b>-Out." Everywhere he walks, a spray of <i>water</i> goes <i>before</i> him to sanitize everything he touches.
