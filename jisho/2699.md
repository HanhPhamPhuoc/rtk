## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 25-7-2007(35): After someone moves into the <em>house</em> next door, and after you give them a <em>best regards</em> gift (something they can fill their <em>shelves</em> with) the <em>words</em> you can now speak are those of<strong> familiarity</strong>. No more &quot; 始めまして &quot; ect.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 24-2-2010(6): When you&#039;ve achieved a certain<strong> familiarity</strong> with a Japanese person, you can do away with <em>words</em> such as &quot;<strong>宜</strong>しくお願いします&quot; （よろしく　おねがいします), roughly meaning &quot;please accept my <em>best regards</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(4): Giving <em>words</em> of <em>best regards</em> can establish<strong> familiarity</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 26-11-2012(1): The <strong>familiarity</strong> depicted here is that between a man, and the <em>words</em> in the books in the <em>shelves</em> of his <em>house</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 11-3-2010(1): My <em>words</em> were &quot;Give my <em>best regards</em> to Mr. Heisig who gave me kanji<strong> familiarity</strong>&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 30-10-2009(1): You know you have achieved<strong> familiarity</strong> with your neighbor when you hear these <em>words</em>: &#039;I&#039;ve built a new room in my house, with a separate entrance, lined with teak <em>bookshelves</em>, and you can move in there so you don&#039;t have to live in such mess with all those books strewn across the floor.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 27-6-2008(): Words..best regards. I&#039;m learning this kanji in the compound: 友誼 ; &quot;friendship&quot;. Note that the base of<strong> Familiarity</strong> is &quot;family&quot;; Due to our<strong> familiarity</strong>, I often give <em>words of best regards</em> to my best-friend&#039;s deceased father, who&#039;s picture/altar is kept on the <em>shelf</em> in his <em>house</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 23-2-2011(): Since living in Japan for a while, the words I have most<strong> familiarity</strong> with are those <em>best regards</em> words.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/killeralgae">killeralgae</a>] 4-9-2010(): The<strong> familiarity</strong> the man has with the hundred of <em>bookshelves</em> under his <em>roof</em> borders on disturbing. He can tell you every title in order starting from the first shelf....

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 16-1-2009(): I made conversation with a random Japanese guy on the street but couldn&#039;t understand anything he said. In fact, the only <em>words</em> he said that had any sense of<strong> familiarity</strong> at all was 宜しくお願いします .
