## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eriklc">eriklc</a>] 20-11-2005(209): Like the saying goes,<strong> Hate</strong> just begets<strong> Hate</strong>. A state of mind that just increases and increases until it explodes. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rivvie">Rivvie</a>] 17-2-2008(85): Your <em>state of mind</em> would turn to<strong> hate</strong> when someone would take away a loved one that was <em>formerly</em> yours. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-8-2007(55): <em>Data</em>&#039;s one true emotion is <strong>hate</strong> for <em>Prince&#039;s</em> music. (Image: Data hunched over hands to his ears and screaming while Picard bobs to Purple Rain). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain+Kanjipants">Captain+Kanjipants</a>] 7-8-2011(47): <strong>Hate</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> that turned the man who was <em>formerly</em> Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(22): <strong>Hate</strong> is unfortunately a <em>state of mind</em> on the <em>increase</em> in today&#039;s society. You may picture<strong> hate</strong> as a green face with red eyes, multiplying wildly (see frame 501 “formerly”). If the mnemonic doesn&#039;t do the job, add the <em>state-of-mind</em> switch. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 2-4-2009(16): This kanji is very graphic and suggestive. All you need is just to visualize. STORY:<strong> Hate</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> when you feel how <em>horns</em> of rage are growing right from your <em>brains</em> and your <em>tongue wagging in the mouth</em> sends curses to the person you<strong> hate</strong>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn">Ceryn</a>] 8-5-2008(14): Lore is a FORMER model of DATA which is why he is flawed and often<strong> HATE</strong>S people. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 15-4-2008(14): <strong>Hate</strong>: this <em>state of mind</em> was <em>formerly</em> controlled by religion. Today, it&#039;s caused by religion. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 11-12-2008(10): (In most of the cases,)<strong> hate</strong> is a <em>state of mind</em> that was <em>formerly</em> love and respect. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 4-10-2007(9): <em>Data</em> found with an <em>increase</em> in human-like feelings came an <em>increase</em> in<strong> hate</strong>.
