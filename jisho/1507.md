When he got <em>happy</em>, of course, it ended up in the news<strong> report</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PrettyKitty">PrettyKitty</a>] 30-4-2008(85): On the news: &quot;We are happy to<strong> report</strong> that stamp-sized bikini bottoms are back in style!&quot; (Well, the men are happy about it, at least.). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happychair">happychair</a>] 14-3-2006(20): The<strong> REPORT</strong> from the doctor made me <em>HAPPY</em> because it said that he had <em>STAMPED</em> out my <em>CROTCH</em> infection.

This story is courtesy of another RTK member (bodhisamaya?), who seems to have deleted it. Hope he/she doesn&#039;t mind.).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 19-3-2009(5): A troll on this site would make alot of stories about &quot;<em>stamping</em>&quot; peoples <em>crotches</em>, however people who<strong> report</strong> the story only make the troll <em>happier</em>.
