## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 2-1-2007(385): If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven&#039;t seen him after his<strong> decline</strong>. Here he is carrying a stick around in his mouth like a dog, begging people to throw it for him. Note that the mouth is closed only after the stick goes in, as is only logical.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-10-2008(44): My kanji writing ability has<strong> decline</strong>d so much even my <em>one</em> looks <em>pathetic</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 4-10-2007(34): If you thought that the dude in 哀 was <em>pathetic</em>, you haven&#039;t seen him after his<strong> decline</strong>. Here he is carrying a <em>stick </em>around in his <em>mouth</em> like a dog, allowing people to rent him and play catch with him for money!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 22-12-2006(25): <em>One pathetic</em> decision after another led to the<strong> decline</strong> and fall of the Roman Empire.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-7-2007(5): Ever since the guy from <a href="../v4/401">pathetic</a> (#401 哀) got a<strong> decline</strong>d by a girl and a <em>walking stick</em> rammed in his mouth sideways, his life has been in<strong> decline</strong>; a downward spiral.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 20-11-2009(3): Nero was <em>one pathetic</em> emperor. He used to make Roman senators wear <em>top hats and scarves</em> and fetch <em>sticks</em> with their <em>mouths</em>. I think this started the<strong> decline</strong> of the Roman empire.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jcdietz03">jcdietz03</a>] 29-8-2010(2): The<strong> DECLINE</strong> and fall of the Roman empire was marked by ONE PATHETIC attempt after another to revive it.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 25-2-2010(2): The <strong>decline</strong> of the <em>pathetic</em> can be watched here: Another one <em>crossed out</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yorkii">yorkii</a>] 25-3-2007(2): The same guy from the &quot;pathetic&quot; story tries to get into a posh resturant or night club. his application is<strong> decline</strong>d and to boot, he gets a walking stick rammed in his pathetic mouth!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiHantaa">KanjiHantaa</a>] 19-4-2013(1): El <strong>declive</strong> del Imperio Romano se debió, en realidad, a que tomaron <em>una</em> decisión <em>patética</em> tras la otra.
