## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 26-5-2007(203): A boy made an <em>altar</em>, but he&#039;s afraid to<strong> show</strong> it to God because he thinks it&#039;s <em>two little</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 15-8-2008(86): &quot;I&#039;ll<strong> SHOW</strong> you mine if you<strong> show</strong> me yours!&quot;, she said. I did &amp; she scoffed because it was <em>TWO LITTLE</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-3-2007(44): I give this form a primitive of <em>EVIL ALTAR</em>. Imagine a black stone altar used for satanic rituals. I give the left radical form a primitive of <em>CHURCH ALTAR</em>. Imagine a beautiful cathedral altar.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 23-3-2009(35): Unrelated: Frankly, I found Chapter 30 BORING. (I guess I was spoiled with Mr. T.) To jazz up the excitement, this ENTIRE chapter is all about one very crazy religion that exists today (in your imagination). What are the specifics? That&#039;s for you to find out. The clues? The next 39 kanji. Just look at some of the keywords: Altar, oil, sleeve, collar, speakth, naked!!! Be sure to give altar it&#039;s own meaning inside the cult you&#039;re creating.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 20-5-2009(7): A picture of an altar. <em>Two small things</em> are placed on it to<strong> show</strong> them off (I imagine two watches covered in diamonds).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 19-2-2009(7): It&#039;s <em>2 Little 2 Ride</em>, a<strong> show</strong> about when Vin Diesel was young.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 25-6-2010(6): 示す <a href="../v4/1086">show</a> (#1086 示)ジ, シ, しめす ... Parts: 二 , 小 ... Note: Heisig got this all wrong, 示 , and ネ look nothing alike. Made especially worse by the fact that in words like 祓う , and 禊 it is the full 示 used on the left. Unless you want to have to remember the <em>shape</em> of the written form (something this whole system is supposed to avoid), always use a different word for 示 and ネ. Bad Heisig, bad. ... 熟語 : 告示 , 指示 , 表示 , 標示 ... cf: 禅宗 , 奈良 .

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 30-1-2008(5): Original shape: someone or something is going to be offered as a sacrifice to the gods. // Abreviated shape at the left: someone or something is praying in front of the ALTAR.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TokyoXtreme">TokyoXtreme</a>] 9-8-2010(4): &quot;<strong>Show</strong> me that you love me, by taking me to the <em>altar</em>.&quot; &quot;Uh, sure baby. <em>Two</em> seconds... uh, I&#039;ll be back in a <em>little</em> bit.&quot; POOF! Never seen again.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hereticalrants">hereticalrants</a>] 9-1-2010(3): To avoid confusion, when this element appears on the left it will mean CULT, refering to a small fanatical religious orginiztion, and when it retains its form it will mean a kind of tribal hoobah, or a<strong> show</strong>ing to the Gods--think Africa here.
