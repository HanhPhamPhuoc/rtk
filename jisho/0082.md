heisig: "When thinking of the key word <b>right</b>, in order to avoid confusion with the previous frame, take advantage of the double meaning here, too. Imagine a little <i>mouth</i> hanging down by your <i>side</i>&nbsp;- like a little voice of conscience - telling you the <b>right</b> thing to do. Here the second stroke should reach out to the <b>right</b> and be drawn slightly longer than the first."
