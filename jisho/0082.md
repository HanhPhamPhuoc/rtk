heisig: "To the right we see a <i>head</i> and to the left an element that means <i>craft</i>. When we think of a <b>paragraph</b>, we immediately think of a <i>heading</i> device to break a text into parts. (Think of the elaborate <i>heads</i> often seen at the start of medieval manuscripts and the task becomes easier still.) Just where and how to do it belongs to the writer's <i>craft</i>. Hence, we define <b>paragraphing</b> as the &quot;<i>heading craft</i>&quot; to remember this character."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crazy88">crazy88</a>] 19-9-2007(237): To write a<strong> paragraph</strong> is the <em>craft</em> of grouping sentences on a <em>page</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 5-2-2008(115): To <em>craft</em> a <em>page</em> well, we need<strong> paragraph</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/libsrone">libsrone</a>] 15-1-2009(23): Well, I tried using craft and headings and pages and none of it stuck, so: Reading a block of text that isn&#039;t broken down into<strong> paragraph</strong>s makes me want to hit myself in the head with an I-beam.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/therapysessions">therapysessions</a>] 3-1-2009(14): A well CRAFTED PAGE is full of beautiful<strong> PARAGRAPH</strong>S.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK">NyahK</a>] 24-11-2009(10): Well-<em>craft</em>ed <em>page</em>s require<strong> paragraph</strong>s.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 11-3-2010(5): <em>Craft</em> of grouping sentences together on a <em>page</em>. To disambiguate from another <em>page / head</em> Kanji with which I repeatedly confused this, 題 <a href="../389">topic</a> (#389 題), I now recall that I must use my <em>carpenter&#039;s square</em> to ensure that the left margin of the<strong> paragraph</strong> is straight.
