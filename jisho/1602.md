heisig: "To our way of counting directions, the <b>west</b> always comes fourth. So it is convenient to find the character for <i>four</i> in this kanji. But since we want only <i>one</i> of the <i>four</i> directions, the <b>west</b> adds the <i>one</i> at the top and sucks the <i>human legs</i> a bit out of their <i>mouth</i> in the process."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 9-2-2007(224): The old<strong> west</strong> represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare <a href="../1427">sign of the bird</a> <span class="index">(#1427 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/酉">酉</a>)</span> whiskey bottle about one third full). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 3-3-2008(49): Note: this kanji is also used to denote Spain. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 22-12-2008(25): The Spaghetti <strong>Western</strong> movies, typified by <em>empty bottles of whisky</em>, were so-called because it was often an Italian director that shot them. Most of these films however, were actually shot in <strong>Spain</strong> (another meaning this kanji holds). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 11-2-2009(21): Only <em>one</em> out of every <em>four</em><strong> west</strong>erns is worth watching. Even that&#039;s debatable. The rest are crap. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akatsukigui">akatsukigui</a>] 24-11-2010(14): <em>One</em> of the <em>four</em> directions: The<strong> West</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-7-2009(8): 1) In English, the <em>one</em> direction listed <em>fourth</em> is<strong> west</strong>. 2) An <em>empty whiskey bottle</em> from the<strong> West</strong> arrived on the shore of Japan, and they thought it was some profound Buddhist message in a bottle, but really it was just the litter of some drunk. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 24-1-2010(3): Primitive: Will Smith as Jim<strong> West</strong> from the movie Wild Wild<strong> West</strong>. Smith drank all the <em>whiskey</em> in the bottle. That&#039;s why we&#039;re missing the line that measures the fluid level. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 9-1-2012(2): Here is a cowboy who has had 4 shots of whiskey! No more whiskey left in the bottle. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jacktaylor">jacktaylor</a>] 4-8-2010(2): As a primitive, this is <strong>Vash the Stampede</strong> from Trigun. The world of Trigun is a lot like the old<strong> west</strong>, and Vash is as sharp-shooting a cowboy as you&#039;ll ever find. Does anyone remember the episode where Vash <em>empties his whiskey bottle</em> several times over and still defeats the bad guys without firing a single shot? 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alfonso">Alfonso</a>] 14-7-2010(2): <strong>West</strong> is one of the directions, and it&#039;s the fourth counting from the north.
