## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 12-11-2007(239): Looks a bit like Ft =&gt; <strong>F</strong>amily <strong>t</strong>itle =&gt;<strong> Family name</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-10-2006(75): The <strong>family name</strong> is important to me! <em>Drop</em> me from a building, torture me with a <em>fishhook</em>, I&#039;m keeping my <em>one</em> <strong>family name</strong>. Hook me with a second <em>fishhook</em>, I refuse to change my <strong>family name</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 20-8-2007(43): This <em>box</em> is full of <em>arrows</em>. <em>Arrows</em> are special: armorer&#039;s <strong>family name</strong> is engraved on each arrowhead (hence last <em>dot</em> is left out).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau24">dilandau24</a>] 28-11-2006(27): Note that the stroke order of this is <em>drop</em>, <em>fishhook</em>, <em>one</em> (<strong>written as normal</strong>, not right to left as Heisig writes) then the second <em>fishhook</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 11-5-2009(14): Hook, is both Hook&#039;s (from Peter Pan) first name and<strong> family name</strong>. So he&#039;s called <em>Hook Hook</em>. But he thought that was a bit silly so he <em>droped</em> the second hook and only uses <em>one</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(10): I wonder what E.T.&#039;s<strong> family name</strong> is? (Et).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 17-5-2008(6): Captain Hook [fishhook] has spent his whole life building up the notoriety and fame of his<strong> family name</strong>. He likes the attention, and his<strong> family name</strong> is like brand that strikes fear in the hearts of his victims. So when he hears about a rookie pirate also going by the surname of Hook, he decides the newbie will simply have to change his name. He tracks down the rookie and confronts him with a simple order: <strong>drop</strong> &quot;<strong>Hook</strong>&quot;. I&#039;m the <strong>one</strong> <strong>Hook</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shrimpster">shrimpster</a>] 28-12-2009(4): My<strong> family name</strong> is 氏 nderson.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-1-2007(4): This is a broken ax. The differences with 斤 are that the second stroke gets a hook at the end and the fourth starts at the top of the blade and has a curved hook at the end. This means that the handle part has broken forward at both ends when the ax was swung (the butt of the ax was obviously used). The ax makers obviously have to bury this one so that the incident will not tarnish their<strong> family name</strong> (of course their axes are the very best!).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 11-8-2010(3): 源氏 , <a href="../1828">family name</a> (#1828 氏) シ, うじ ... Parts: (戊-丶)＊ ... Note: Used as a suffix in formal address like -さん, -さま ... Keyword Hassles: 姓 <a href="../1557">surname</a> (#1557 姓) is a legal thing: like whether you are a Woman, or whether you are <em>Alive</em>. On the other hand, 氏 <a href="../1828">family name</a> (#1828 氏) is heritage thing. Maria Shriver is a Kennedy, even though it is not in her surname. ... 熟語 : ... cf:.
