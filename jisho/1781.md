## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-3-2007(286): A whole team of cops is sent to <strong>investigate</strong> how a <em>tree</em> could grow on top of a <em>shelf</em> with no soil or water.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 9-10-2007(86): The result of the inverstigation of the missing <em>Trees</em>? Why, most of them had become <em>shelfs</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 2-5-2009(43): Police suspected that some <em>wooden shelves</em> had come from illigaly lumbered timber in the Amazon. They launched an investigation in to the matter. &quot;Trees are more important than shelves and therefore should be placed on top&quot; A spokesman for the police said in an interview.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 18-3-2009(20): Why the hell would a <em>tree</em> be growing on a <em>shelf</em>? Time to<strong> investigate</strong>. Also time to think up a story that makes more damn sense.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 19-8-2009(5): I have a little potted <em>tree</em> sitting on my <em>shelf</em>, and I found a note in it that said &quot;You will die in 3 days.&quot; So, naturally I try to figure out who put it there! Dave Chappelle did a comedy special way back (1997) where he does an impression of a white guy in a horror movie with just one line, &#039;I&#039;d better<strong> investigate</strong>!&#039; That would be me in this situation.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 25-7-2008(5): Like the &quot;ero inquiry&quot; that had been partially swept under the rug (see <a href="../1145">inquire</a> (#1145 尋)), this kanji depicts the <strong>investigation</strong> into the <em>forestry</em> scandal being <em>shelved</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 11-2-2010(4): The <em>Cat in the Hat</em> is the newest cast member of CSI: Crime Scene <strong>Investigators</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lisbet">lisbet</a>] 12-1-2012(3): In <strong>investigating</strong> where the tree in my front yard had gone, I discovered my neighbor had a nice new wooden bookcase.
