## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 29-6-2008(344): I like to<strong> RUB</strong> my FINGERS over my EXTREMITIES ....like my extremity-ly long, umm, hair.... This has been edited in response to being reported ...you can change &quot;hair&quot; to whatever extremity-ly long body part you like. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/forestsprite">forestsprite</a>] 30-9-2007(114): When you&#039;re cold, your<strong> RUB</strong> your FINGERS over your EXTREMITIES vigorously to warm up a bit. I&#039;d still rather go in for a warm fire and some hot cocoa, though. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samusam">samusam</a>] 18-9-2007(72): Picture Mr. Burn&#039;s<strong> rub</strong>bing the <em>extremities</em> of his <em>fingers</em> together and saying &quot;excellent...&quot;. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 21-5-2008(41): This is easy. What other <em>extremities</em> could you possibly use to<strong> RUB</strong> something? We use our <em>fingers</em>, of course. (I do appreciate the tendency to read perverted things into kanji, but sometimes a more logical approach is better). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 21-7-2008(20): This means<strong> rub</strong> as in &quot;rubbed out&quot; or &quot;erased.&quot;--  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/抹消">抹消</a>   【まっしょう】 (n,vs) erasure; delete (e.g., DEL character); (P).   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/抹殺">抹殺</a>   【まっさつ】 (n,vs) erasure; denial; obliteration; ignoring (an opinion); (P)   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/抹茶">抹茶</a>  (P);   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/末茶">末茶</a>  (iK) 【まっちゃ】 (n) powdered green tea for ceremonies; (P) STORY: Think of God using his huge FINGER to<strong> RUB</strong> OUT/ERASE the unnecessary EXTREMITIES of the world. Similarly to how a young child uses their finger to<strong> rub</strong> out an ant hole ant by ant. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 12-4-2009(17): I asked the pretty young masseuse to use her <em>fingers</em> to<strong> rub</strong> my <em>extremities</em> too. She told me that this ain&#039;t that kind of place! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miyadamuraman">miyadamuraman</a>] 16-6-2011(16): For those of you reporting because or perverse meanings. Read any book on memory mnemonics like what you&#039;re currently using. They will all say the more sexual you make a story the more likely you are to remember it. Quit reporting stories that will actually work.<strong> Rub</strong> whatever extremity you like, in my case I&#039;ll<strong> rub</strong> my longest. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alucard">Alucard</a>] 21-1-2007(8): You<strong> rub</strong> things with the extremity of your fingers. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 7-5-2009(5): A foot massage--using a <em>finger</em> to<strong> rub</strong> the <em>extremities</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(5): It&#039;s a cold day in winter, you&#039;re wearing mitts, and you<strong> rub</strong> the extremities of your fingers to warm them up. I&#039;m referring to gloves with the extremities cut off, hence you<strong> rub</strong> the <em>extremities</em> of the <em>fingers</em>.
