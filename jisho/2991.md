heisig: <i>Bamboo</i> . . . <i>float</i>. Note that the drawing of the primitive for <i>float</i> uses the abbreviated form that has become standard in the general-use kanji and as we met it earlier (Frames 393-95). Until such time as typesetting fonts make the adjustment, only the older form has been approved. Here we have opted for the simpler, avant garde drawing.
