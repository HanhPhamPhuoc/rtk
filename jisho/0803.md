2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 20-1-2007(62): The cubans build a pipe to flood the USA. Castro just has to turn the<strong> valve</strong> on it, and USA is flooded. Suddenly, CIA agents tackle him from behind, grabbing both his arms. But <em>Castro</em> manages to open the<strong> valve</strong> with his <em>elbow</em>, by raising the <em>elbow</em> above his head. Success! USA is no more...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 10-6-2008(17): &quot;She&#039;s stuck real good-like&quot; the guy from the いなか ( 田舎 ; country) said to me with a strong rural <strong>dialect</strong> ( 弁 ; べん). &quot;You best grab on ta&#039;er with <em>both hands</em> and giv-er that<strong> VALVE</strong> some <em>elba</em>&#039; greeze.&quot; (I couldn&#039;t resist: this is a favourite Japanese word of mine, which also means &quot;regional dialect.&quot; Such as Osaka-ben 大阪弁 ; almost all prefectures in Japan will boast of their own 弁 and slang).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 16-7-2008(12): Also means <strong>dialect</strong>. In some languages like Greek and Italian you use your two hands to communicate as much as you use your mouth. In some dialects, apparently, you also use your elbows...

The life-giving ichor flooded out, and Talos collapsed in a dead heap. Do not listen to those who say that the<strong> valve</strong> was on Talos&#039;s ankle. They are wrong. It was on his <em>elbow</em>.
