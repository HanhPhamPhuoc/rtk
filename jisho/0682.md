## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FooSoft">FooSoft</a>] 1-1-2010(38): I&#039;m in a <em>state of mind</em> where I <strong>desire</strong> to see the <em>sun</em> over the <em>capital</em> for some nice <em>scenery</em> for a change (no more rain!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 16-9-2010(16): Think of a commercial designed at making you <strong>hanker</strong> for the product they&#039;re advertising. See how they cleverly use that <em>scenery</em> to put you in the <em>state of mind</em> they desire.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/algarich">algarich</a>] 26-12-2010(6): A prison cell can be nice for a while, but after some time your <em>state of mind</em> will change and you will <strong>hanker</strong> for more <em>scenery</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp">aaroncp</a>] 19-10-2011(3): I&#039;m often in a <em>state of mind</em> where I <strong>desire</strong> to see some beautiful scenery. That&#039;s why traveling is necessary to keep me in a good <em>state of mind</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 18-10-2010(3): The <em>scenery</em> of Texas puts <em>Data</em> in the <em>state of mind</em> to<strong> hanker</strong> for a Roy&#039;s roast beef burger.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dannyboy4885">dannyboy4885</a>] 26-9-2012(2): <em>Data</em> grew sick of space and <strong>hankered</strong> for some <em>scenery</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fvenegas">fvenegas</a>] 31-1-2012(1): We&#039;ve all come across that type of person, the one who&#039;s state of mind changes with every change of scenery he or she experiences. How many times have you heard those types say after a trip &quot;I have a<strong> hanker</strong>ing to move there!&quot; What a premature expression of feelings.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 17-1-2011(1): I am in a<strong> hanker</strong>ing <em>state of mind</em> for some <em>scenery</em>. That is what I am a<strong> hanker</strong>ing for.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 11-1-2010(1): <strong>desire</strong>: When it comes to <em>scenery</em>, <strong>desire</strong> is a<em> state of mind</em> many people hold. Stuck in their boring urban cities.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 24-1-2012(): I have a real<strong> hanker</strong>ing for some New York scenery... particularly a midget rally at the capitol on a sunny day.
