## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phauna">phauna</a>] 28-2-2008(201): <em>Ghosts</em> have <em>not yet</em> left the world, they must still have a deep<strong> fascination</strong> with their past life on Earth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bananarama">bananarama</a>] 3-3-2008(53): Even in these modern times our<strong> fascination</strong> with ghosts has not yet ended.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 16-2-2011(37): The only people who have a<strong> fascination</strong> with <em>oni</em> are those that have <em>not yet</em> met one. 魅力 (みりょく) : charm,<strong> fascination</strong>, glamour.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-1-2006(33): Here the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; founder talks about his<strong> fascination</strong> for <em>ghosts</em> (picture Dan Arkroyd in the movie if that helps). He says he has a<strong> fascination</strong> for ghosts ever since he saw one as a teenager. Since then he&#039;s been scouring all of the world, trying to capture them on tape, on video... A journalist asks &quot;When will it end ? Aren&#039;t you tired of chasing ghosts ?&quot; &quot;Oh no, <em>not yet</em> ! Not until I become a <em>ghost</em> myself anyway !&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 6-3-2010(30): Your<strong> fascination</strong> with <em>ghosts</em> is because you have <em>not yet</em> seen one. When you do, you&#039;ll do your best to get as far from them as possible...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 2-7-2008(19): (Note: I couldn&#039;t picture not yet in this at all, so I combined it with little sister) My little sister, even though she&#039;s NOT YET an adult who can understand such things, has a bizarre<strong> fascination</strong> with ONI. She&#039;s always at the library studying them, drawing them, telling grizly folk stories etc. It&#039;s very unfeminine (hence the lack of 女 ).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 2-11-2006(10): A lot of groupies have a<strong> FASCINATION</strong> with GHOSTS, NOT YET realizing how dangerous they are.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-7-2009(5): People who&#039;ve <em>not yet</em> encountered a <em>ghost</em> are the only ones with a<strong> fascination</strong> with them. Those who have aren&#039;t interested in seeing another.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 8-1-2007(5): One who has not yet seen an ogre may have morbid<strong> fascination</strong> for them. Note the ogre pulling the poor fellow into its clutches with its leg.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 22-3-2009(4): Demons like to extend their reach (stretched out leg) to ensnare those who show a<strong> fascination</strong> with the occult but are <strong>not yet</strong> wise to the dangers lurking therein.
