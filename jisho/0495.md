## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GenPDP7">GenPDP7</a>] 20-12-2007(234): When you<strong> call on</strong> someone, you point your words in their direction. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 22-3-2007(71): Japanese streets usually don&#039;t have names, so finding places can be difficult. So if you plan to<strong> call on</strong> someone you need two things; 1) <em>words</em> (for asking the way) and 2) a <em>compass</em> (in case you get really lost). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 18-12-2006(52): When <strong>calling on</strong> a girl, you&#039;d better what what sweet <em>words</em> will turn her fancy in your <em>direction</em>. (Image: last century teenagers on a frilly couch in the sitting room, she with her back to him, and he fumbling for the right words to turn her around). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 26-1-2008(25): For this key word &#039;<strong> CALL ON</strong> &#039; and the more useful meaning of &#039;<strong>visit</strong>&#039;, think of: a booty call! Haven&#039;t you ever got a late night call from someone (on their <em>mobile</em>), asking for <em>words</em> of <em>direction</em> to your place? Quick, get out your Marvin Gaye record... 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 21-7-2008(23): Note: this kanzi means more like &quot;visit&quot;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/訪ねる">訪ねる</a>   【たずねる】 (v1,vt) to visit; (P). Thus, you VISIT another country that uses different WORDS than yours (language) and you have to find your way around with a COMPASS since you can&#039;t ask anyone for directions or read any signs. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 17-12-2008(17): <strong>Call on</strong> me when you need some words of direction. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 19-7-2007(9): When you need to<strong> call on</strong> someone, do not forget to ask him to tell you the <em>directions</em> to reach him. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kyoti">kyoti</a>] 6-3-2010(6): عندما &quot;تزور&quot; بلد لا تعرف كلماته فإنك تضطر الى استخدام بوصلة لمعرفة الاتجاه. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 3-4-2009(5): TO VISIT: When you are visiting someone, you are in the car, and you call him from the CELLPHONE asking for DIRECTIONS. This kanji really means TO VISIT   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/訪ねる">訪ねる</a>   (たずねる). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 15-5-2013(4): &quot;You can<strong> call on</strong> me anytime&quot; she <em>said</em>, and as soon as I heard those <em>words</em> I knew I would be heading in her <em>direction</em> soon.
