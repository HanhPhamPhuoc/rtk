heisig: The character in this frame represents a step up from the <i>stream</i> we met in Frame 134; it is a full-sized <b>river</b>. The <i>water</i> to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the <i>can</i> at the right tells us that our "little engine that <i>could</i>" has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip' like a regular riverboat.
