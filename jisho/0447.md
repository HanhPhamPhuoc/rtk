This kanji show a unique <b>system</b> for leading <i>cows</i> to the slaughterer's <i>saber</i>: one ties a <i>belt</i> about their waist and fixes that <i>belt</i> to an overhead cable, pulling the <i>cow</i> up into the air where it hangs suspended, helpless against the fate that awaits it.

## Koohii stories:

He only wears the sword because he&#039;s part of the <em>bushi</em><strong> SYSTEM</strong>. Actually, he studies ikebana, shodo, and zen. Imagine him sitting cross-legged in a Zen temple (a very <em>Special</em> Zen temple). The master asks him if a dog has buddha nature and, shifting the swords in his belt, he calmly replies, &quot;Moo!&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fredde79">fredde79</a>] 4-9-2007(26): I used Heisig story here but i tweaked it a little. It works better for me if i imagine the belt is around the tail of the cow, cause that it what it looks like in the kanji.
