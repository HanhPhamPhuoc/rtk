heisig: "<b>Running</b>, we are told here, <i>mends</i> the <i>soil</i>. Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for <i>road</i> does; and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened."

## Heisig story:

<b>Running</b>, we are told here, <i>mends</i> the <i>soil</i>. Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for <i>road</i> does; and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samchan">Samchan</a>] 4-8-2008(319): Hint: This kanji is NOT <em>soil</em> on top of <em>mend</em>, as Heisig claims - that would duplicate one of the strokes. Instead, it is <em>10</em> on top of <em>mend</em>. So my story is: If you<strong> run</strong> <em>10</em> miles, you will need to <em>mend</em> your socks!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/poseid0n">poseid0n</a>] 11-7-2007(33): The sports ground needs MENDING after the game as the players have been<strong> RUN</strong>NING around which has caused the ground to be chopped up.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonjimbo2000">jonjimbo2000</a>] 11-4-2007(29): The <em>soil</em> needs <em>mending</em> after the cross-country<strong> run</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fjolnir">fjolnir</a>] 6-12-2009(18): If you<strong> run</strong> <em>10</em> miles you&#039;ll need to <em>mend</em> your socks.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 16-5-2009(9): With ten things to mend, you&#039;ve got to<strong> run</strong> to get it all done.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hanako1975">hanako1975</a>] 14-1-2008(8): If you<strong> run</strong> around on the hard <em>ground</em> too much, your shoes will need <em>mending</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 4-10-2008(5): I use <em>perfectionist</em> (<a href="../379">correct</a> (#379 正) + <a href="../951">person</a> (#951 人)) instead of <em>mending</em> for the primitive in the lower part. Only a <em>perfectionist</em> can<strong> run</strong> <em>ten</em> times <em>ten</em> metres in <em>ten</em> seconds.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alphador">alphador</a>] 17-1-2010(4): Per CORRERE bene è necessario farlo su una pista ben pianeggiante e senza ostacoli, quindi TERRENO deve essere prima RIPARATO.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 4-7-2008(4): See 382. STORY: The CORRECT PERSON for the DIRT is the one who can<strong> RUN</strong> like Forest Gump.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k">At0m5k</a>] 15-8-2008(3): After a big game where athletes have been<strong> run</strong>ning all over <em>soil</em> of the ground with cleats, it has to be <em>mend</em>ed before the next game. Picture a football team <strong>running</strong> across a field, tearing up the <em>soil</em> with the cleats on their shoes, and the poor work crew trying to keep up and <em>mend</em> it right behind them.
