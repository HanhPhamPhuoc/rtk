## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 10-1-2007(143): A good<strong> friend</strong> is always at your side. ---- I teach at a Japanese High School, and I often see chummy male students grabbing each other&#039;s crotches in a joking manner. It&#039;s still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor&#039;s crotch is a great way to express<strong> friend</strong>ship.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 4-3-2008(111): Think of a sex<strong> friend</strong> (a fuck buddy if you will). The benefit of such a relationship is that there will always be a <em>crotch by your side</em>. (the Japanese refer to such a<strong> friend</strong> as セフレ, just as we do).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 24-10-2006(64): <strong>Friend</strong>s with benefits anyone?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 18-8-2008(32): A<strong> friend</strong> is always on your side - again and again and again.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 27-12-2007(32): Your best<strong> friend</strong> is your crotch. Its always by your side and never lets you down.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/markal">markal</a>] 3-4-2009(21): I think my favorite pet dog from my childhood, &quot;man&#039;s best<strong> friend</strong>&quot;: always BY YOUR SIDE and sniffing your CROTCH.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 5-9-2007(9): Chris Rock once had this joke that went something like this: &quot;Girls don&#039;t have platonic guy<strong> friend</strong>s. They just have a d--k in a glass case. In case of emergency, all they gotta do is break that glass.&quot; Well, imagine your<strong> friend</strong>, in a similar light, only rather than a d--k in a glass case, he&#039;s a <em>crotch by your side</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rujiel">Rujiel</a>] 31-12-2009(7): Ahh, the<strong> friend</strong> zone: the state of constantly having <em>crotch by your side</em> and never being able to..

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 29-11-2007(7): A true<strong> friend</strong> is one <em>by your side</em> who blocks any sucker punches to your <em>crotch</em> with his own.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theich">theich</a>] 22-7-2009(5): Ein guter <strong>Freund</strong> ist immer <em>an deiner Seite</em> - auf <em>Schritt</em> und Tritt.
