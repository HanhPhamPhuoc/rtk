heisig: "The primitive elements that compose this character are <i>ten</i> and <i>mouth</i>, but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with <b>old</b> inscriptions on the tombstones. This departure from the primitive elements in favor of a pictograph will take place now and again at these early stages, and almost never after that. So you need not worry about cluttering up your memory with too many character &quot;drawings.&quot;"
