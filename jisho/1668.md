## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 24-9-2006(183): [True story] In Osaka the homeless (the<strong> alienate</strong>d) live in large numbers around the city <em>zoo</em>. Picture them in winter all <em>bundled</em> up in rags trying to keep warm,<strong> alienate</strong>d from the society, living literally worst than the animals in the <em>zoo</em> who at least are <em>bundled</em> in their natural furs and have pens to live in sheltered from the elements. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 10-7-2007(85): This kanji is so strange that it was<strong> alienate</strong>d at the kanji <em>zoo</em>. The <em>bundle</em> of joy stork bundles this kanji up and takes it to a kanji foster home. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 10-9-2006(49): Think of a Kanji <em>Zoo</em>, where we <em>bundle</em> up all the bizarre and hard to remember kanji, to be ridiculed and <em>alienated</em> from the other more sensible kanji. This kanji definately belongs there! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 16-5-2008(23): The cleaner at the ZOO felt<strong> ALIENATE</strong>D by everyone. Granted, he was carrying around the BUNDLE of manure he cleaned from the ZOO cages. (Just picture a zoo cleaner carrying a bundle of dung with the crowd avoiding him). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 20-2-2008(15): Very rarely does this kanji appear in a word meaning &quot;alienate.&quot; The better meaning is &quot;sparse,&quot; such as not dense, very few, scattered, or spread irregularly. It also appears in words that have to do with &quot;neglect.&quot;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/疎ら">疎ら</a>   【まばら】 (adj-na,n) sparse; (P) STORY: at the ZOO BUNDLES of happy animals are SPARSE. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 25-10-2010(14): It&#039;s a bit of a stretch calling the left element <em>zoo</em>...it could just as easily be a modified <em>chop-seal</em> and <em>stop</em>, couldn&#039;t it? In MIB, aliens are <em>stop</em>ped at immigration and either get a <em>chop-seal</em> on their passport, or are <em>bundle</em>d off-planet where they will feel<strong> alienate</strong>d.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/過疎">過疎</a>   (かそ) : depopulation;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/疎か">疎か</a>   (おろそか) : neglect, negligence, carelessness. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mickymay">mickymay</a>] 29-4-2012(13): For those than do not see the zoo here: &quot;Maマ, stop   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/止">止</a>  　bundling　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/束">束</a>  　me up in those strange clothes! You<strong> alienate</strong> me from my school mates! (be careful the second stoke of マ is omitted). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 2-5-2008(7): This <em>zoo</em> <strong>alienates</strong> its animals terribly! It even ties them up in <em>bundles</em> to transport them! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beneus">Beneus</a>] 18-2-2009(6): <strong>Alienate</strong> means treating like an alien. So what would we do with an alien? of course we&#039;d just <em>bundle</em> him up and rush off to sell him to the nearest <em>zoo</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 30-6-2008(6): (Thanks esaulgd) This <em>zoo</em> <strong>alienates</strong> its animals terribly! Poor animals want to take their <em>bundle</em> and leave the place.
