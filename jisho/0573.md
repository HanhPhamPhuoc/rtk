## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 27-10-2007(219): It seems bizarre, but<strong> tortoise</strong>s are a genetic cross with the head of a fish and the tail of an eel. Where the shell comes from, no one knows.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skylarth">skylarth</a>] 15-6-2008(118): A<strong> tortoise</strong> is <em>prosperity</em> <em>bound up</em> with a <em>tail</em>. They are very lucky creatures.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 18-4-2009(30): <strong>Tortoise</strong>s are known to live relatively long lives (it is not uncommon for them to exceed 100 years of age). Thus, a<strong> tortoise</strong> is a creature that is <em>bound</em> by its shell to see <em>many days</em>, with its little tail peeking out.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yuta73">Yuta73</a>] 20-11-2010(26): <strong>Tortoise</strong>. DBZ. This is goku&#039;s symbol in his back. How can I forget it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(9): [addition to dwhitman&#039;s] It seems bizarre, but<strong> tortoise</strong>s are a genetic cross with the head of a fish and the tail of an eel. They are the symbol of prosperity (stroke order).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 1-11-2006(8): One character was <em>bound up</em> by his hubris, while the other was quite <em>prosperous</em>. There was a <em>hook</em> at the end, which was the moral &quot;slow and steady wins the race.&quot; What story is this? Why, &quot;The<strong> Tortoise</strong> and the Hare,&quot; of couse.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enn_are">enn_are</a>] 17-3-2008(7): Unlike the turtle, the<strong> tortoise</strong> could not see the portents so was bound to have his prosperous days ruined by a fishing hook.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 10-2-2009(5): Thomas Edison didn&#039;t invent the<strong> tortoise</strong> shell lamp; Dr. Frankenstein did. He took the central nervous system (brain) of an electric eel, bound it up in wire, and implanted it into a<strong> tortoise</strong>&#039;s body. The motivation for this &quot;brilliant&quot; invention? Those torches that the Transylvanian villagers carried always made him feel a bit nervous.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/japanralf">japanralf</a>] 9-3-2008(5): If you bind up a brain on the back of an eel it may look like a<strong> tortoise</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 16-10-2010(4): 亀鑑 , 亀 <a href="../v4/534">tortoise</a> (#534 亀) キ, かめ, (+ many name readings) ... Parts: 勹, 田 , 田 , 乚 ( 旧字体 : 龜) ... Story: The Ganges river in India is sacred, so many bodies are &#039;buried&#039; there. These dead bodies accumulate, causing health problems, so they have trained<strong> tortoise</strong> to eat the bodies. They trained them by <em>Binding 2 Brains on a Hook</em> to get them used to the taste. (true story: <a href="http://bit.ly/aSAeMR">http://bit.ly/aSAeMR</a> ).
