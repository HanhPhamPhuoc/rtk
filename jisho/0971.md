## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 16-5-2006(224): Taking<strong> appellation</strong> to mean the act of naming, we have the <em>little</em> baby superman <em>reclining</em> in the space craft that landed in a <em>wheat</em> field. Mr. and Mrs. Kent look down and decide to call him Clark. (I also thought of Jesus but he was born in a barn full of hay not wheat).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 17-1-2007(119): <em>WHEAT</em> that is <em>RECLINING</em> and <em>LITTLE</em> (<em>small</em>) can&#039;t get the <em>APPELLATION</em> &quot;quality wheat&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 3-11-2007(87): An Indian chief explains the art of<strong> appellation</strong> by introducing his three children: Swaying <em>Wheat</em>, <em>Reclining</em> Buffalo and <em>Little</em> Bear.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 18-7-2006(47): The way this <em>wheat</em> <em>reclines</em> a <em>little</em> justifies its<strong> appellation</strong>: &quot;lazy wheat&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 5-1-2009(24): If you&#039;re having trouble thinking of a name for your little one, go lie down in a field of wheat for a while and gaze at the stars.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vmous">vmous</a>] 11-9-2009(12): <strong>Appellation</strong> contrôlée vin de <em>blé</em>. Gardez la bouteille couchée et dégustez dans de <em>petits</em> verres.<strong> Appellation</strong> controlee for <em>wheat</em> wine. Store the bottle <em>reclined</em>. Drink in <em>small</em> glasses.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 5-4-2009(9): When my wife told me she wanted the<strong> APPELLATION</strong> of our kid to be in honor of her favorite CEREAL, &quot;Trix,&quot; I had to LAY DOWN for a FEW minutes to recover.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Benzhi">Benzhi</a>] 12-12-2008(8): In the late autumn, you go outside and <em>recline</em> in the soft <em>wheat</em> fields, looking up at the sky. Laying there, you feel like such a <em>small</em> part of the universe. The seconds seem to slip away, until you hear your mother <strong>call your name</strong> to come back home.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 17-8-2008(8): My favorite<strong> APPELLATION</strong> (i.e., nickname given) is &quot;Buck<em>WHEAT</em>&quot; from the &quot;<em>LITTLE</em> Rascals&quot; show. I used to watch it while <em>RECLINING</em> on the couch every Saturday morning.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 9-1-2008(7): <strong>Appellation</strong> as a call to the gods; an appeal for help. The <em>wheat</em> farmer&#039;s crops are dying. He runs into the field, gets down on his knees, and throws his body back so he is <em>lying down</em> facing the heavens. &quot;Help meeeee!!!&quot; he screams, as his screams echo through the heavens and the camera zooms out farther and farther (the farmer in his field... the field in the city... the city in the state... the state in the country... the country in the earth...). The farmer looks so <em>small</em> as the camera zooms out.
