heisig: Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the <b>creek</b> is often no more then a dribble of <i>water</i> trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of <i>water</i> is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how <b>creeks</b> are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of <i>water</i> somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The <b>creek</b> is thus a lesson in <i>water-craft</i>, as this kanji would agree.
