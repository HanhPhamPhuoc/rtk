## Heisig story:

Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few fingers to see a good pictograph of a <b>hand</b> in this character. But that it is, and so you must.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-1-2007(99): This pictograph actually really works if you look at it as a<strong> hand</strong> with fingers spread and middle finger pointing down. see the very top stroke as the edge of a shirt cuff, and it will all come together.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 4-8-2009(86): A<strong> hand</strong> is useful for 千一 (1001) things.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 25-2-2007(33): Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. (the 6-fingered man).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 23-11-2006(13): Heisig says it&#039;s not a very good pictograph of a human<strong> hand</strong>, but it <em>is</em> a good pictograph of a cartoon<strong> hand</strong>. Picture Mickey Mouse&#039;s distinctive white glove with its three fingers and a thumb. The kanji that use this element can also use <em>Mickey Mouse</em> as a primitive element in place of <em>hand</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 4-5-2009(7): The slightly bent <em>nail</em> went through <em>two</em> of the <strong>hand</strong>&#039;s fingers (this one is pretty easy to memorize).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brainrobert1">brainrobert1</a>] 28-2-2011(5): A<strong> hand</strong> is good for doing 1000 and 1 things. 千 and 一 .

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(4): Pictograph, see book.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hornlo">hornlo</a>] 29-8-2010(3): [ <strong>hand</strong> ] - just remember it.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 7-8-2010(2): Here&#039;s how I see it as a diagram: the drop at the top is the palm, the two horizontal strokes are the joints of a finger, and the vertical stroke is the length of the finger. Hence, when you remove the &quot;palm&quot; stroke at the top, the <strong>hand</strong> kanji becomes the <em>finger</em> primitive.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dzurn">dzurn</a>] 10-9-2011(1): A <strong>HAND</strong> is useful for 千一 (1001) things. Wave yo&#039;<strong> hand</strong> to SHOO te fly away. (ON: SHU; KUN: te). [tnx mantixen, sam].
