## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 5-10-2006(325): <em>One</em><strong> officer</strong> can change the course of <em>history</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 24-3-2008(95): <em>One</em><strong> officer</strong>, namely Napoleon, changed the course of <em>history</em>. (Thanks, ayoung24). Napoleon is also my primitive meaning.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 1-7-2007(37): In a police state, the police<strong> officer</strong>s all speak with <em>one mouth</em> and have a gun tucked <em>under their arm</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 3-7-2011(26): This is not <a href="../1095">military officer</a> (#1095 尉), but more of a government<strong> officer</strong>, official or bureaucrat, such as Barack Obama, who started out as a lowly government<strong> officer</strong> (communitee organizer) and the broke through the glass <em>ceiling</em> to become president of the United States and make <em>history</em> (I know a glass ceiling generally refers to an obstacle for women, but I wanted to avoid key words such as <a href="../98">woman</a> (#98 女), <a href="../1151">lady</a> (#1151 婦) or <a href="../563">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌)).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 3-10-2006(20): I used HISTORY as a primitive rather than separating it into &#039;mouth&#039; and &#039;tucked under the arm&#039;. Think about the Japanese history textbook controversy. The government<strong> OFFICER</strong>S choosing the textbooks are the ONE elite group determining Japan&#039;s HISTORY.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 13-9-2007(9): &quot;What seems to be the problem,<strong> officer</strong>?&quot; You ask through your open car window. He replies: &quot;I just got back from running your license plate through the system and it seems that you have a long history of crime. In fact, your the number one, most wanted criminal in this county.&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sleepyday">sleepyday</a>] 24-9-2008(8): All<strong> officer</strong>s have <em>one</em> <em>mouth</em> that they feed doughnuts to. Just look at that deluxe box of 50 <em>tucked under the arm</em> of that <em>one</em><strong> officer</strong> with the cream-stick in his <em>mouth</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 9-8-2008(5): &quot;<em>One</em><strong> officer</strong> can change the course of <em>history</em>. &quot; (Thanks ayoung24.) Think of Frank Serpico. Here&#039;s a quote about him from his wikipedia page: &quot;Frank Serpico - The first police<strong> officer</strong> not only in the history of the New York Police Department, but in the history of any police department in the whole United States, to step forward to report and subsequently testify openly about widespread, systematic cop corruption-payoffs amounting to millions of dollars.&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 27-4-2007(5): An<strong> officer</strong> also has &quot;<em>one mouth</em> under his <em>arm</em>&quot;. It&#039;s the gun in his shoulder holster. You better listen to it.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-10-2005(4): In the same vein as the previous frame, here we have an<strong> officer</strong> <em>tucked under the arm</em>, as “<em>the one mouth</em>” from which we get the official word on things.
