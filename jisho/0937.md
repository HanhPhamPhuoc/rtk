## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 30-6-2008(99): Pandas like to eat<strong> bamboo</strong>. I&#039;m using panda as the primitive name when it fits the story. ^__^. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 5-7-2009(39): Two <em>reclining</em> victims impaled by<strong> bamboo</strong> <em>spikes</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 18-11-2007(36): Since this is a really common kanji and so easy to remember on its own, I just remembered it by it&#039;s reading, which is たけ. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 27-9-2010(9): I see this pictographically. Stroke 1: leaf. Stroke 2: joint of stalk. Stroke 3: section of stalk. And it&#039;s doubled because it comes in groves (just as you double &quot;tree&quot; to make &quot;grove&quot;). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigpapalove17">bigpapalove17</a>] 10-10-2010(6): Oh NO, NO (think katakana), two pieces of<strong> BAMBOO</strong> stabbed TJ. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 10-10-2006(6): (Thanks, ivoSF)　　 Ranma ½&#039;s Genma the Panda, often chomping away on <strong>bamboo</strong>, sometimes holding up a sign, sometimes doing horrible things to Ranma. To remember that the second<strong> bamboo</strong> is hooked, not the first... The first one block some of the second&#039;s sunlight, so the second has to hook a little to get its fair share. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 25-5-2009(5): This kinda looks like <a href="../873">going</a> <span class="index">(#873 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/行">行</a>)</span> to me, so I just think of how fast<strong> bamboo</strong> grows, like it&#039;s <em>going upward</em> really fast. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 29-3-2008(4): <strong>Bamboo</strong> is skinny and long with RECLINING leaves. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiwiburner">kiwiburner</a>] 23-8-2012(3): <strong>Bamboo</strong> pictograph - the drop is the notch for each new moon&#039;s growth. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 17-5-2012(2): Just remember it.
