heisig: "Bushel basket . . . yawn. bushel basket As the two legs at the bottom suggest, this bushel basket is a large container, standing on the floor. Its first four strokes indicate that it is made of wicker, much like the small wicker basket treated immediately above. To put something inside of the bushel basket, the legs at the bottom are attached to the final horizontal stroke and extended to make a kind of enclosure. [8]"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-3-2007(197): Kasparov practices <strong>deceit</strong> by grabbing your <em>rook</em> while pretending to <em>yawn</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 13-3-2007(128): Every day, a smuggler takes <em>bushel baskets</em> on donkeys across the border. But the border patrols can never arrest him for <em>lack</em> of evidence no matter how much they search the <em>bushel baskets</em>: they can&#039;t find whatever he is smuggling. What was his<strong> deceit</strong>? He was smuggling donkeys!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 28-2-2007(82): Bushel-basket = pictograph of chess rook (running over the board). Trying to deceive the opponent with a yawn while positioning a rook on the board.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 14-11-2009(59): Note - everyone uses this primitive to symbolize chess/rook in the following frames (don&#039;t bother with &quot;bushel basket&quot;).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberstuber">uberstuber</a>] 21-6-2007(31): <strong>Deceit</strong>! Someone must have moved one of my <em>chess pieces</em> while I waws <em>yawning</em>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 30-9-2007(20): (thanks, guidedog) We think that <em>Garry Kasparov</em>&#039;s genius lies solely in his ability to think several moves in advance. The truth is that he frequently practises<strong> deceit</strong> by delaying his move to force his opponent to <em>yawn</em>. It is at this precise moment, that he shifts the position of key pieces on the board to gain a<strong> deceit</strong>ful advantage.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>] 14-3-2010(9): The Primitive bushelbasket is inconvenient imo. I think it looks like a <strong>Pokute</strong>, the funny little creatures from the hilarious anime &#039;Jungle wa itsumo Hale nochi Guu&#039;. Here&#039;s a short documentary about Pokute, you&#039;ll see the similarity! <a href="http://img71.imageshack.us/img71/6628/pokute3vp.gif">http://img71.imageshack.us/img71/6628/pokute3vp.gif</a> Story for<strong> deceit</strong>: A <strong>pokute</strong> is never tired, so when it&#039;s yawning, you know it&#039;s <strong>deceiving</strong> you.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 9-8-2010(8): Note: RTK3 has a similar kanji <a href="../v4/2806">cheat</a> (#2806 騙) which means &quot;deceive&quot;. 欺 means &quot;deceit, cheat, delude&quot; so I changed 欺 to &quot;cheat&quot; and 騙 to &quot;deceive&quot;. Switching the keywords also matches the best stories for each kanji. Story (dingomick variation): Kasparov <strong>cheats</strong> by sneaking an extra <em>rook</em> onto the board when you close your eyes to <em>yawn</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark">mistamark</a>] 12-1-2009(6): It was a<strong> deceit</strong>! the <em>bushel basket</em> <em>lack</em>ed what I wanted.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shank">shank</a>] 26-2-2012(5): [Primitive: rook] What manner of<strong> deceit</strong> is this? I <em>yawn</em> for a brief second and now I&#039;m lacking a <em>rook</em>.
