## Heisig story:

&quot;To <b>lose</b>&quot; here takes the sense of &quot;misplace,&quot; not the sense of <i>defeat</i>, whose kanji we learned in frame 67. It pictures a <i>husband</i> with something falling from his side as he is walking along, something he <b>loses</b>.

## Premitive:

As a primitive, this character can also mean to drop.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rich_f">rich_f</a>] 19-7-2007(222): The <em>drop</em> falling here is the <em>husband&#039;s</em> toupee... he&#039;s already <strong>lost</strong> his hair once, now he&#039;s <strong>losing</strong> it again. Such is life, I suppose.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-8-2007(64): Note: Heisig&#039;s stroke order is wrong. It&#039;s the same as vermilion, drop first. <em>Homer</em> <strong>loses/drops</strong> his wedding ring.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marydj">marydj</a>] 21-10-2007(43): My husband is going to<strong> lose</strong> his hair, one drop at a time.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 22-6-2008(11): The <em>husband</em> has <strong>lost</strong> his job ( 失業する ), yet on his way out of the office he bows respectfully one last time (the drop signifying his deep bow), saying &quot;shitsurei shimasu&quot; ( 失礼しあす ).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 13-6-2008(11): I used to put a tag on my <em>husband</em> so I wouldn&#039;t<strong> lose</strong> him, but then one day a woman thought it was a price tag and tried to buy him. No worries, though. After that incident I switched to microchips.
