## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 23-8-2007(213): A vegetarian vulture is munching on a <em>flower</em>, perched on a <em>tree</em>, patiently waiting for a patch of<strong> vegetable</strong>s to grow.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 5-6-2008(98): <em><a href="../v4/2090">grab</a> (#2090 采)</em> beneath the <em>flowers</em> to get the<strong> vegetable</strong>s. 野菜 やさい.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 18-12-2007(86): Wolverine is turning into total hippie. He said he only eats<strong> vegetable</strong>s now and last time I saw him sitting in a tree with flowers in his hair.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 30-1-2008(21): Nobody likes to eat their<strong> vegetable</strong>s, not even <em>vultures</em> who will eat anything. So they hide in a <em>flower</em>-covered <em>tree</em>, until the scary<strong> vegetable</strong>s disappear. Picture the ugly vulture head peeking out from behind the flowers.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delbertmon">delbertmon</a>] 26-11-2009(15): Tip: vulture + tree : Heisig later combines these into a single kanji 采 called grab (<strong>2090). --- Story: Many<strong> vegetable</strong>s are roots and so you take their flowers and grab them in order to harvest the<strong> vegetable</strong>. --- REF: &quot;grab&quot; also appears in pick (</strong>733), coloring (#1714 彩).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 3-6-2007(14): In a world of all<strong> vegetable</strong>s (no meat), vultures would become peace loving hippies, lounging around in trees all day, wearing flowers in their plumes/hair.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asakk">Asakk</a>] 23-5-2009(11): Examples of<strong> VEGETABLE</strong>S are: &#039;FLOWERS&#039;, &#039;CLAWliflowers&#039; and &#039;TREES&#039;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 13-5-2008(10): Monster <em>flower</em>s walk into town and <em>grab</em> all the <strong>vegetables</strong>; liberating their plant brothers. vulture + tree = <a href="../v4/2090">grab</a> (#2090 采).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spoonz">Spoonz</a>] 3-3-2009(5): Picture a<strong> vegetable</strong> in the ground... first you have the flower peeking out the ground then you have the tree (root) below the ground... then you use your claws to yank it out of the ground. (my<strong> vegetable</strong> image was a carrot :D) <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v282/spoonz/carrot.jpg">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v282/spoonz/carrot.jpg</a> helpful picture.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 29-1-2010(4): A Cauliflower is the perfect example of a<strong> VEGETABLE</strong>: It sounds like FLOWER, it looks like a CLAW and its green like a TREE. Therefore it representsVEGETABLEs.
