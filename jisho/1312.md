## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 5-3-2008(113): <em>The Pinnacle</em>, to me, is a city that makes itself out to be perfect but is filled with dirty secrets that photographers are always trying to reveal (see <a href="../1044">dissolve</a> <span class="index">(#1044 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/融">融</a>)</span> The city&#039;s councilmen have<strong> isolate</strong>d all professional photographers to make sure they don&#039;t photograph these &quot;dirty secrets&quot;. (which are up to your imagination). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 24-10-2007(97): The people of the <em>pinnacle</em><strong> isolate</strong> themselves, <em>dissolving</em> any outside friendships. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/playadom">playadom</a>] 20-6-2008(77): Sadly, since the Pinnacle is<strong> isolate</strong>d, they have no modern technology. Their only means of photography is an old camera. What&#039;s that? Forgot how old cameras work? Let me show you: Light is captured through the lens (one mouth), the photographer is in a giant hood, all you can see out of it are his human legs. He holds his flash controller(a spike) in hand. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma">shimouma</a>] 23-6-2008(21): Imagine the landscape photographer, like Ansel Adams,<strong> isolate</strong>d and alone at the pinancle taking pictures with his camera. (See zenkun&#039;s story for (FRAME 1044) dissolve). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 6-10-2009(18): Do you remember the poor insect in <a href="../1044">dissolve</a> <span class="index">(#1044 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/融">融</a>)</span>? Actually, it was not dissolved - it was beamed right into the <em>pinnacle</em> prison for committing the crime of disturbing a <em>photographer preparing for a snapshot</em> and now lives<strong> isolate</strong>d until the end of its three days long life... (note:   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/隔てる">隔てる</a>   (へだてる) also means to <strong>disturb ones view</strong>). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 22-7-2007(14): Because The Pinnacle is so<strong> isolate</strong>d, they are able to grow illegal venus fly traps. (The kind that don&#039;t eat bugs, wink wink). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 16-7-2009(10): To avoid food allergies, every ingredient in <em>The Pinnacle</em>&#039;s kitchen is<strong> isolate</strong>d to it&#039;s own <em>Reki</em> (3-legged steamer) and only mixed on your plate. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 12-8-2006(9): If you use the right side of this kanji to mean <em>photographer</em> as in Zenkun&#039;s story for <a href="../1044">dissolve</a> <span class="index">(#1044 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/融">融</a>)</span>, think of a great nature <em>photographer</em> <strong>isolating</strong> just the <em>pinnacle</em> he finds most beautiful in a mountain scene. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 15-10-2006(5): Trigger:<strong> Isolate</strong>/Insulate <em>Welding-man</em> (see <a href="../1044">dissolve</a> <span class="index">(#1044 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/融">融</a>)</span>) is<strong> isolate</strong>d and insulated from others working high at <em>The Pinnacle</em> welding the steel girders in place. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yuta73">Yuta73</a>] 13-1-2012(4): Easy: The city at the <em>pinnacle</em> is so <strong>isolated</strong>, that they still use the ancient chinese <em>three legged kettle</em> 鬲 for heating water.
