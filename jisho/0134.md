heisig: "We have taken the image of a river <b>stream</b> over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a <b>stream</b>. As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of STREAM the more vivid image of a FLOOD. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements: on the left, it is written XXX on the top, it is written XXX on the bottom, it is written XXX SIMPLE So as not to confuse this with river (#146) think of streamers falling down."
