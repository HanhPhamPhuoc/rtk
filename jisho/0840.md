## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-8-2007(189): The Simpsons are on vacation. <em>Homer</em> stops to take a leak in a <strong>mountain stream</strong> but gets snatched by an <em>eagle</em>. Hear his scream?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-4-2006(92): A husband who went fishing at the<strong> mountain stream</strong> to feed his family, fell in the rapids (we&#039;ll assume this is a large<strong> mountain stream</strong>). He is saved from the waters by a great eagle. He comes back home with nothing to feed the family, his clothes still dripping wet as he tells his wife of how he was saved by a great eagle, and of course she does not believe him. The story continues in <a href="../1947">chicken</a> (#1947 鶏).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 3-3-2008(46): The water from the<strong> mountain stream</strong> saved my husband from thirst, dehydration and the vultures.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 22-5-2012(23): The <em>water</em> from the<strong> mountain stream</strong> saved the <em>husband</em> from <em>vultures</em> (see <a href="../1947">chicken</a> (#1947 鶏) for another example of vulture over husband).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 31-12-2006(19): Did you ever wonder where the <em>water</em> in<strong> mountain stream</strong>s came from? It comes from <em>vultures</em> peeing. Anyone knowing the anatomical and temperamental differences between the sexes will also realize that the <em>water</em> comes from the <em>vulture</em> <em>husbands</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saizen">saizen</a>] 23-7-2008(18): This kanji derives from when the <em>husband</em> of the family would go to the<strong> mountain stream</strong>, wade in the <em>water</em>, and <em>claw</em> at the fish like a <em>vulture</em>. This was a man&#039;s duty in order to feed his family..and how well he could do it was often the talk of the village.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/agrant">agrant</a>] 26-11-2010(11): ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLkCcKZEaYo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLkCcKZEaYo</a>) This is a Chinese man (<em>Husband</em>) using a bird (in our case, a <em>vulture</em>) in the <em>waters</em> of the<strong> mountain stream</strong> to help him catch fish. It&#039;s as if the video was made for this Kanji.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kigabit">kigabit</a>] 27-10-2009(8): My <em>husband</em> says there were <em>vultures</em> circling above him for miles, hoping he&#039;d die soon, and were probably disappointed when he finally found <em>water</em> at the <strong>mountain stream</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 8-4-2009(8): The<strong> mountain stream</strong> is the <em>water</em> where you can see the <em>vulture</em> and the <em>husband</em> both fishing.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mickymay">mickymay</a>] 16-5-2011(6): 渓 ＊たに＊　This Kanji means valley and does not take the notion of stream until combined with another Kanji like 水 or 流 . Only in the case of 渓声 it actually means &quot;sound of a valley stream&quot;. Giving it is rarely used it should not concern us too much. But just imagine a picturesque mountain valley with majestic bird in the air and grandmother&#039;s husband sitting at the right of that<strong> mountain stream</strong> on a green meadow. Like in a Heidi scenery. You don&#039;t know ハイジ!? <a href="http://www.heidi.ne.jp/">http://www.heidi.ne.jp/</a>.
