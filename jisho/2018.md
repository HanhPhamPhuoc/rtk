## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laxxy">laxxy</a>] 16-10-2006(175): When workers neglect workplace safety, their fingers get cut off and carried away by the<strong> conveyor</strong> belt, which looks like a &#039;finger carrier&#039; in that case.

The morse code specialist was the<strong> conveyor</strong> of messages to and from the crew of the carrier, using his fingers to tap out the secret messages. (This works especially well for 搬送周波数 carrier frequency and 搬送波 carrier wave, being the radio waves/frequencies used in morse code).
