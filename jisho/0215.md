heisig: "<b>Parch</b>ment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial <b>parch</b>ment from <i>wood</i> pulp. The <i>fire</i> at the left and in the &quot;strong&quot; position serves to remind us of the root word, &quot;<b>parch</b>,&quot; since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like <i>fire</i>. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a &quot;<i>wood-good</i>,&quot;), wet it, and hold it over a <i>hearth</i> in your mind's eye. Now watch as it <b>parches</b> the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling <b>parch</b>ment."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(273): Tip: <em>goods</em> + <em>wood/tree</em> : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it&#039;s worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest &quot;<em>furniture</em>&quot; (a common type of <em>wooden goods</em>). REF: <em>parch</em> (FRAME 215) , <a href="../671">maneuver</a> (#671 操), <a href="../1369">winding</a> (#1369 繰), <a href="../2035">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻). Story: It&#039;s been so<strong> parch</strong>ed recently that your <em>furniture</em> suddenly catches <em>fire</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 18-8-2007(76): The<strong> parch</strong>ment says you need <em>fire</em> to make <em>good</em>s from <em>tree</em>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 24-1-2009(42): When a FIRE is<strong> parch</strong>ed, it isn&#039;t thirsty for water, it wants to gobble up some WOODEN GOODIES!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 5-4-2008(33): ソウ &quot;A <em>fire&#039;s</em> heat will<strong> parch</strong>/dry out any <em>goods</em> made from <em>wood</em>.&quot; E.G. 乾燥する （かんそう・する）to dry up.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 12-1-2010(29): Hint: Actually the element - 喿 - is itself a rare kanji, that has the meaning of &quot;chirping of birds&quot; (see these little mouthes on the tree). On - ソウ/ ショウ Kun さわ.ぐ/ かしま.しい/すき.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 24-5-2009(22): After all those recent California forest <em>fires</em>, the poor <em>birds chirping</em> in the <em>tree</em>s must be<strong> parch</strong>ed! (Thanks to LazyNomad for providing the meaning of [goods] over [tree] = [chirping birds].

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 15-9-2008(13): You need to leave milk out for Santa. If not, he will be so<strong> parch</strong>ed when he comes down the FIRE place that he will put the GOODS on top of the TREE!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek">peepiceek</a>] 5-5-2008(12): When the land is<strong> parch</strong>ed, <em>fire</em> will destroy all the <em>goods</em> that the <em>tree</em> provides.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/distantstar">distantstar</a>] 10-3-2010(8): <strong>Parch</strong>ed by the <em>fire</em> the <em>birds chirped</em> noisily. Hint: the element - 喿 - has the meaning of &quot;chirping of birds&quot; (see the little mouths in the tree). Thanks to LazyNomad! Also you can find it in these noisy characters 譟, 噪.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 23-6-2006(7): Wood + goods = paper. You need to sear the special paper with fire in order to make a<strong> parch</strong>ment, thus<strong> parch</strong>.
