heisig: <b>Parch</b>ment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial <b>parch</b>ment from <i>wood</i> pulp. The <i>fire</i> at the left and in the "strong" position serves to remind us of the root word, "<b>parch</b>," since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like <i>fire</i>. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a "<i>wood-good</i>,"), wet it, and hold it over a <i>hearth</i> in your mind's eye. Now watch as it <b>parches</b> the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling <b>parch</b>ment.
