## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 14-12-2006(188): Religious freedom has not always been respected throughout history, and nobody knew how to force religion on an indigenous people like the Spanish missionaries. They posted conquistadors at either side of the <em>altars</em> at the local missions, and if anybody refused to<strong> pray</strong>, they would get the <em>axe</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 23-5-2008(129): A warrior<strong> pray</strong>s for victory before the battle. He kneels at the <em>altar</em>, his battle <em>axe</em> at the ready. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 30-9-2006(34): When you come to the <em>altar</em> to<strong> pray</strong>, you need to leave your <em>axe</em> to one side. Biblical quote, settle your differences with someone before coming before your god. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 14-5-2007(27): At the altar ax da Lord and<strong> pray</strong> to help ya! Hallelujah! 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 11-4-2007(15): D&amp;D: the religious dwarf<strong> pray</strong> at the <em>altar</em>, with his trusty <em>axe</em> at his side. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squeaky_lill_mk">squeaky_lill_mk</a>] 17-11-2010(13): Gimli <strong>praying</strong> at Balin&#039;s tomb like at the <em>altar</em>, holding his <em>axe</em> in his right hand. <a href="http://scrapbook.theonering.net/scrapbook/movies/sets/moria/view/1347">http://scrapbook.theonering.net/scrapbook/movies/sets/moria/view/1347</a>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 7-10-2007(9): Good ol&#039; horror movies and their cliches. Here we see a<strong> PRAY</strong>ING man, kneeled before an ALTAR (think of any better place to<strong> PRAY</strong>?),<strong> PRAY</strong>ING to all the gods that that AXE wielding man behind him wot&#039;t cut him to pieces. Sadly, the<strong> PRAY</strong>ER goes unanswered, much to the delight of gore fans. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 6-9-2008(8): <strong>Pray</strong> at the <em>altar</em> or get the &quot;<em>axe</em>&quot;! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 6-5-2010(7): At the altar: &quot;God, can I axe you a question?&quot;. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 20-2-2006(6): When you<strong> pray</strong>, you put your hands together in the shape of an axe.
