heisig: "This kanji is actually a pictograph for an eye, distorted to make it appear that the pupil is protruding towards the right. This may not be an easy form to remember, but try this: Draw it once rather large, and notice how moving the two vertical lines on the right as far right as possible gives you the pictograph of the eye in its natural form. The "pop-eye" image belongs to an Emperor's <b>retainer</b> standing in awe before his ruler."
