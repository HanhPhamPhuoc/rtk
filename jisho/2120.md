heisig: "Learning this character will take a little doing.

The picture of <b>gloom</b> begins with a small <i>grove</i> of trees, under which we see a <i>crown</i> made out of used <i>tin cans</i>.

A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc">mcbainpc</a>] 26-4-2010(76): I&#039;m depressed that this kanji has 29 strokes.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 1-3-2012(49): In the middle of the GROVE you find a TIN CAN. There&#039;s a CROWN inside! You are very excited with your finding, but then a figure appears behind you: &quot;Hey, gimme that kid!&quot; You turn back and it&#039;s WOLVERINE, with a SHOVEL on his back and all COVERED IN <a href="../v4/2866">rocksalt</a> (#2866 鹵) &quot;I found that crown in the rocksalt mines over there, so hand it over!&quot; Unless you wanna die, you hand him the crown and he goes away. Then you SIT ON THE FLOOR, feeling impotent, and the SHAPE of your face becomes all <strong>GLOOMY ☹ (The 終 !)</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 2-6-2011(22): A popular mnemonic device for this character is: リンカーンはアメリカンコーヒーを３杯飲んだ . Here&#039;s how it works: <a href="http://google.com/#q=リンカーンは⇒林＋缶＋ワ">リンカーンは⇒林＋缶＋ワ</a> <a href="http://google.com/#q=アメリカンコーヒーを⇒米＋コ＋ヒ">アメリカンコーヒーを⇒米＋コ＋ヒ</a> <a href="http://google.com/#q=３杯飲んだ⇒ノ＋ノ＋ノ">３杯飲んだ⇒ノ＋ノ＋ノ</a> .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 3-11-2009(16): Note: 鬱 and 欝 <a href="../v4/2856">depressed</a> (#2856 欝) are variants. In such cases it may be easier to use the same keyword, calling the other kanji &quot;keyword (alt)&quot;. 鬱 is the more common of the two and is in the new Joyo kanji list.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 14-11-2009(8): <strong>Sulky</strong>: let the bottom left 鬯 (rock salt + spoon) = salt shaker: The kid in the restaurant is <strong>sulky</strong> when the <em>salt shaker</em> and <em>can</em> of coke spills all over his cardboard (<em>wooden</em>) birthday crown, creating a massively <em>shaped</em> sticky puddle all over the floor.

Story: Sitting in the <strong>Gloom</strong> of the <em>grove</em>, wearing a <em>tin can crown</em>, <em>shaping fragrant herbs(鬯)</em> into trinkets to sell to tourists who trample my grove, and take away the <em>fragrant herbs</em>, and leave their <em>tin cans</em>. I hate my life: The <strong>Gloom</strong> is not just the mood from the forest.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aberu">aberu</a>] 7-2-2010(6): The depressed <em>TIN-CAN</em> sat between two <em>TREE</em>s with its <em>CROWN</em> on as the <em>VILLAIN</em> ate out of it with a <em>SPOON</em> and laughed at its funny <em>SHAPE</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Henkka">Henkka</a>] 1-3-2011(5): This depressed <em>tin can</em> fellow sitting <em>between the trees</em> stopped being so damned <strong>gloomy</strong> all the time once he got rid of his tin <em>crown</em>, smoked some of those funny-looking <em>fragrant herbs</em> and noticed all the fun <em>shapes</em> of the kanji around him, learning them all!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 24-12-2010(4): <em>Tin can grove crowns</em> the <em>fragrant herb shape</em>. WTF, I get <strong>gloomy</strong> just trying to come up with a story for this crap.
