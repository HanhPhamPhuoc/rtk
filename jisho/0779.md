## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(69): Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive, using the image of going through a door, even one that stands alone with the frame and no wall around, helps flesh out the primitive “enter”. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vgambit">vgambit</a>] 26-12-2008(36): Gordon Freeman <strong>enters</strong> the Black Mesa corporation&#039;s headquarters on that fateful day, after starting up a game of Half-Life (this kanji looks exactly like the lambda from the logo when written). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 11-8-2008(11): Something only a Native American could pull off instead of saying &quot;Come in please.&quot;. When used as a primitive, instead of<strong> enter</strong>, I use a <strong>tepee</strong> for this character.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sdrobertm">sdrobertm</a>] 23-1-2011(3): ***As a primitive, &quot;enter&quot; is far to vague so I will give it meaning of &quot;door knob&quot; which is the first thing we touch when<strong> enter</strong>ing a room or building. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hornlo">hornlo</a>] 14-9-2010(3): [ <strong>enter</strong> ] - just remember it; draw as backslash leaning left on a prop; cf <a href="../8">eight</a> <span class="index">(#8 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/八">八</a>)</span>, <a href="../951">person</a> <span class="index">(#951 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/人">人</a>)</span>, <a href="../767">exit</a> <span class="index">(#767 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/出">出</a>)</span> : (<em>to come/put/go in</em>, etc.; leave gap at top).
