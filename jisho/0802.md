heisig: "The simplest way to remember this character is to see it as built up from that for <i>branch</i>. The first stroke can then stand for something &quot;hanging&quot; down from the <i>branch</i>, namely its bark or <b>pelt</b>. The barb at the end of the second stroke is the only other change. Merely by concentrating on this as you write the following small cluster of characters should be enough to fix the form in your mind. By way of exception, you might doodle around with the kanji's form to see what you can come up with."
