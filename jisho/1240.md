But the King always cared more for the older brother   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/兄">兄</a>  , since he was to succeed the throne. That made the<strong> younger brother</strong>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/弟">弟</a>   grow increasingly devilish to get the King&#039;s attention. In secret, the<strong> younger brother</strong>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/弟">弟</a>   killed his own brother and sent his <em>condolences</em> to the King, but along with the right to the throne, he obtained both <em>horns</em> and a <em>tail</em>, representing his malice.
