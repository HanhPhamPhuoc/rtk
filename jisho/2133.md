## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 13-10-2008(43): <em>Wolverine</em> waiting atop a <em>tree</em> to spring down on <em>Sabre</em>tooth at any<strong> moment</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-1-2007(25): The kendo artist takes a brief<strong> moment</strong> to practice his skills: he throws <em>sheafs</em> over the <em>tree</em> and tries to cut them with his <em>saber</em> when they come down again.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 1-1-2009(15): Wtf<strong> moment</strong>? This kanji means temple. Wooden x-men statues with sabres guard the entrance to the Professor Xavier temple. Might help if you imagine the two x-men as Wolverine and Sabretooth.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 5-7-2009(11): You pray in a <strong>temple</strong> (see herman) when you suddenly hear the sound of cracking <em>wood</em>. You know that <em>Wolverine</em> lurks around and that he will try to <a href="../1493">kill</a> (#1493 殺) you in a few <strong>moment</strong>s. &quot;Shit! I should have taken my missle launcher with me!&quot; You draw your <em>sabre</em> and prepare for the attack.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 6-2-2013(7): Kendo artist takes a <strong>moment</strong> in the <strong>temple</strong> before tossing <em>sheafs</em> over the <em>tree</em> and slicing them with his <em>sabre</em> as they came back down.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 17-5-2010(7): How ironic! <a href="../1493">kill</a> (#1493 殺) 殺 was itself killed when it was cut in half by a <em>sabre</em> blow before it had a chance to deploy it&#039;s &#039;missile&#039;. It all happened in a<strong> moment</strong>. It&#039;s remains are interred at a <strong>temple</strong> (a meaning of this kanji). Careful with <a href="../1462">instant</a> (#1462 即).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 12-1-2009(7): In a few<strong> moment</strong>s, we will be commencing the documentary &quot;How to <em>kill</em> with a <em>saber</em> instead of <em>missiles</em>&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 6-11-2011(4): WOLVERINE waits for perfect<strong> moment</strong> to leap from the TREE and kill the guy with the SABER.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 14-7-2010(3): Means <strong>temple</strong> not<strong> moment</strong>. I think Heisig was trying to think ahead to compounds. This means<strong> moment</strong>: 刹那 （せつな）.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LittleFishChan">LittleFishChan</a>] 25-10-2007(3): SATSU; Standing in front of a temple, a samurai hones his skills while waiting for the test to begin. Throwing some sheaves in the air in front of a tree (From his perspective the sheaves are above the tree) he waits for the precise<strong> moment</strong> to cut both of them in half at the exact same time (Or<strong> moment</strong>).
