## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(65): Many <em>deer</em> can be found in the <em>grove</em> at the<strong> foot of a mountain</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(18): <em>Deer</em> are well known for frolicking in <em>groves</em> of <em>trees</em>. However, they are not well known for actually watching where the heck they are bounding about. Here we have a bunch of dead <em>deer</em> bodies that you find at the<strong> foot of a mountain</strong>. You are trying to figure why there are so many dead <em>deer</em> in one spot, and then you trace a line up the mountain - leaves and such are scattered all the way up...to a grove. Looks like they hopped through some leaves to their doom.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 30-7-2008(8): The cave with the <em>deer</em> painting was found at the <strong>foot of a mountain</strong> hidden behind a <em>grove</em>. That&#039;s why it took centuries to discover.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 18-3-2010(5): <em>Deer</em> live in the <strong>foot</strong>hills <strong>of mountains</strong> where they can hide and shelter in <em>groves of trees</em>. Consequently, you won&#039;t find them ABOVE the &#039;tree line&#039;. Note: To avoid confusion with <em>mountain goat</em> 屰, remember those wild goats are way up above the tree line on steep rocky slopes. Deer thrive in leafy green woods and pastures.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 22-12-2009(4): Sacred <em>deer</em> live in the <em>grove</em> at the <strong>foot of the mountain</strong>, foliage so thick that one cannot see the mountain itself.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 27-11-2010(1): 山麓 , 岳麓 , 麓 , <a href="../2839">foot of a mountain</a> (#2839 麓) ロク( 鹿 ), ふもと ... Parts: 林 , 鹿 ... similar: 岳麓 <a href="../2839">foot of a mountain</a> (#2839 麓), 裾野 <a href="../2624">hem</a> (#2624 裾) ... Story: Sakurajima the Volcano in <em>Kagoshima</em> ( 鹿児島 ) keeps erupting, killing off the <em>Groves</em> on the upper reaches of the mountain. SO now there are only <em>Groves</em> at the <strong>Foot Of the Mountain</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 31-10-2010(1): I struggled to get down to the foot of the mountain, too many trees in the way. Then a deer came to me, and let me ride it down.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tguk911">tguk911</a>] 30-5-2013(): The poor <em>deer</em> were forced out of their home once the <em>grove</em> was destroyed so now they live at the<strong> foot of a mountain</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/juandixonformvp">juandixonformvp</a>] 9-10-2012(): A deer stampede is when you scare some deer out of a grove of trees so they fall off the mountain. Then you collect the deer carcass at the foot of the mountain. (changing dihutenosa&#039;s story).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Altaira">Altaira</a>] 18-7-2012(): The <em>grove</em> AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN was a sacred hiding place for <em>deer</em>.
