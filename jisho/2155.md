2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 14-5-2009(28): For me, the kanji looks like a picture of two eyes. Somebody<strong> bash</strong>ed the right one until it burst open. Ugh... Put a stamp on it - I don&#039;t want to see it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 9-7-2009(3): Hey, if you<strong> bash</strong> somebody in the mouth and your wearing a ring it kinda leaves a stamp on their skin... Cool do it again, do it again.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-2-2007(3): The<strong> Bash</strong> Street Kids are always <strong>bashing</strong> people. To stop their victims from crying for help they first stick <em>stamps</em> on their <em>mouths</em>.

Kazelee closes the thread, certain no one knows he started the thing under a sixth identity &amp; <strong>bash</strong>ed himself under a seventh in the first place.
