## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 7-7-2006(240): <em>Eastern</em> Siberia is often<strong> frozen</strong> by <em>ice</em>. According to wikipedia, Yakutia (in Eastern Siberia) holds the record as the coldest town on Earth. Check it out yourself...it made it stick for me!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wizard">Wizard</a>] 13-6-2008(97): The <em>ice</em> will stay<strong> frozen</strong> until the <em>sun</em> is visible through the <em>trees</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 9-12-2007(18): It is always the <em>east</em> side of anything, mountain, yard, forest, that stays<strong> frozen</strong> with <em>ice</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 4-2-2009(7): ICE will stay<strong> FROZEN</strong> during the night, until the SUN rises over the EAST TREES.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h">dat5h</a>] 11-7-2009(6): Imagine your freezer ( 冷凍庫 れいとうこ) breaking down in the middle of the winter. The temperatures are just around freezing (it&#039;ll have to do). So you decide to bury all of your food in the <em>ice</em> outside to keep it fresh. As the sun rises in the <em>east</em> you must quickly move all of your perishables to the other side because of melting (of course remembering to move it back as the sun moves over the trees to the other side). It&#039;s tiresome but it&#039;ll have to do until you can fix the freezer.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 27-6-2010(5): <strong>Frozen</strong> mochi <em>ice</em> cream is an <em>East</em>ern treat.

As the sun sets, the land that is no longer touched by sun <strong>freezes</strong> over. In fact, you can see the line of advancing <em>ice</em> coming from the <em>east</em>. <em>Remember that the sun sets in the west, and the ice, which is kept at bay by the sun, advances from the opposite direction (the east)</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yurypetrov">yurypetrov</a>] 22-5-2011(3): In the East of Russia ice is literally everywhere (permafrost). Ice keeps the ground<strong> frozen</strong>.
