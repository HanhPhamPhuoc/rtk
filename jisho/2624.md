It&#039;s a little known fact that Bobby Fischer&#039;s classic win with black in the third game against Boris Spassky was the result of one white pawn made of <em>bamboo</em> rather than boxwood, which was light enough to be blown away when the mechanism Fischer had rigged to his clock turned on a<strong> winnowing fan</strong> in the remote control camera he had been fiddling with before the match.
