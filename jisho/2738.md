## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-7-2007(31): I used a <em>metal</em><strong> awl</strong> to drill right through this here <em>turkey</em>: it was so much easier than using a knife to cut it open!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(4): The <em>turkey</em> was so tough we had to use a <em>metal</em><strong> awl</strong> to get started carving it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 21-1-2010(3): The only way to hobble the gobble of the <em>metal turkey</em> is to run him through with a <em>gold</em>en<strong> awl</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 7-2-2009(3): To carve a <em>metal</em> <em>turkey</em>, an <strong>awl</strong> is the best tool for the job.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 25-1-2011(2): I&#039;m changing this to <strong>cone</strong>, as it often seems to have that meaning. STORY: I&#039;ve invented <em>Turkey</em> in a Cone! Now you squirt Turkey product on your bread and spread it like cheese whiz! I&#039;m gonna be rich! I can see the <em>gold</em> pouring in!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Louismi">Louismi</a>] 25-5-2011(1): I use this metal<strong> awl</strong> to pierce this turkey and cook it.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-8-2010(1): 円錐 , <a href="../2760">awl</a> (#2760 錐) スイ, きり ... Parts: 金 , 隹 ...

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 5-1-2012(): This is the <em>metal</em><strong> awl</strong> that I used to kill the <em>turkey</em> we&#039;re having for dinner. (I imagine myself dressed in full camo, face painted as well, crouching in the brush next to a <em>turkey</em> with my <em>metal</em><strong> awl</strong> in hand, until I sneak up behind it like Sam Fisher, put my hand over it&#039;s beak and slice it&#039;s throat open with the <strong>awl</strong>, then stab it repeatedly in the breast until it dies. Then I arrive home splattered with blood with a limp <em>turkey</em> and a bloody <em>metal</em><strong> awl</strong>, and everyone just accepts this as normal).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spot53">Spot53</a>] 1-11-2011(): Robotnic&#039;s solid metal turkey cannot even be defeated with an<strong> AWL</strong>, though it is pretty humerous that Sonic even thought to try that...
