## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 27-2-2006(168): The beaurocracy in Japan is such that even altars need to be<strong> inspection</strong> approved. A little man with glasses comes once a year to give the <em>altar</em> a &quot;visual once over&quot; as he calls it (perhaps checking for unauthorised symbology?).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 2-9-2006(105): [inspection; regard as; see; look at] <strong>Inspection</strong>: you 示 <a href="../1086">show</a> (#1086 示) and someone else 見 <a href="../57">see</a> (#57 見).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phauna">phauna</a>] 13-2-2008(71): (Thanks to Ricardo) There&#039;s an<strong> inspection</strong> in the church. You <em>show</em> the altar, and the inspector <em>sees</em> if it&#039;s okay or not.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 19-11-2008(23): At the <em>altar</em>, god <em>looks</em> at you, in an<strong> inspection</strong> of your soul.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 27-2-2006(14): The stone cutter inspects the altars with his keen eyesight for details. The surface must be smooth as ice, not a blemish must be seen. Very well, let me see the next stone altar.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 21-11-2008(9): Langdon from Da Vinci Code is proceeding with the<strong> inspection</strong> of the <em>altar</em>, by <em>looking</em> at all the symbols.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 25-11-2008(8): Police come for an<strong> inspection</strong> of items placed around the <em>altar</em>. people report <em>seeing</em> drugs hidden under there.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Seiska">Seiska</a>] 20-6-2010(7): Indiana Jones inspecting an altar and sees a hidden switch.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 7-5-2013(4): <strong>Inspection</strong> of <em>Church of Scientology</em> documents following an FBI raid allowed the world to <em>see</em> just what a despicable organisation the <em>Church of Scientology</em> was in the 1970&#039;s. I wonder, if there were to be a similar<strong> inspection</strong> of <em>Church of Scientology</em> documents today, what we would <em>see</em>?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 18-1-2010(4): The Police are conducting an<strong> inspection</strong> at a Catholic church for any signs of foul play. The first place they LOOK is under the ALTAR.
