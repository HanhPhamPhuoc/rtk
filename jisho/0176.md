heisig: "These are the same <b>carp</b> you see in Japanese &quot;<b>carp</b> streamers.&quot; Only here we find a small home <i>computer</i> or two strung on the line by a father anxious for his son not only to have the courage and determination of a <b>carp</b> swimming upstream, but also the efficiency and memory of a <i>computer</i>. Ugh."
