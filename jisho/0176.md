heisig: "The primitives in this kanji read: <i>water</i> . . . <i>inflammation</i>. Taking <i>inflammation</i> in its medical sense, the first <i>water</i>-related <i>inflammation</i> that pops into mind is dehydration, the principal symptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and look very, very <b>thin</b>. If that is hard to remember, try thinking it backwards: a very <b>thin</b> chap passes by and you imagine him suffering from (being <i>inflamed</i> with) dehydration (hence the element for <i>water</i>)."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 11-10-2006(328): Drink <em>water</em> and <em>burn twice</em> as many calories as you eat... you&#039;ll definitely get<strong> thin</strong>. Imagine inside your body, all those calories literally being <em>burned</em> from above and below... THAT&#039;s what it takes to become<strong> thin</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 5-11-2008(182): <strong>Thin</strong> girls are twice as hot when they&#039;re wet.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 31-7-2008(32): Adding <em>water</em> to an <em>inflammation</em> sure will make it a <strong>thin</strong> <em>fire</em>.

I remember it using its kun yomi : awa(i), because i see volcanic islands with water around. Yes Hawaii... (the kanji key whose keyword is dilute actually means<strong> thin</strong>).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 3-4-2008(23): For my vacation I went to Mexico and man, that Mexican <em>water</em> totally <em>inflamed</em> my stomach.
