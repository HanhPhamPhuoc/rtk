heisig: Perhaps you know the custom of seeding <b>grass</b> randomly or in some particular pattern with the <i>flower</i> called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in <i>early</i> spring. As the <b>grass</b> begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny <i>flowers</i> dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of <b>grass</b> somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in <i>flowers</i> once as a sort of <i>early</i> harbinger of spring.
