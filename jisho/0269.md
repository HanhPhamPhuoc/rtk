heisig: "If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of <b>gold</b> bullion with an <i>umbrella</i> overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the <i>scepters</i> of the kingdom, <i>drop</i> by <i>drop</i>, and shaping them into bars."
