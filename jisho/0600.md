## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 9-3-2006(206): <strong>Reef</strong>s are often formed from volcanic rock, or &quot;rock that has been charred&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 12-10-2006(173): Coral<strong> reef</strong>s are now dying off due to our abuse of the environment and now look like <em>charred stone</em>. For a picture illustrating this, see <a href="http://www.nacri.org/images/Hof-dredgingfig8.jpg">http://www.nacri.org/images/Hof-dredgingfig8.jpg</a>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruukukun">ruukukun</a>] 26-7-2010(28): You may be familiar with this unfortunate natural phenomenon. The Coral <strong>Reef</strong>s are some of the most beautiful habitats in the world, full of color and life. However, recently due to overfishing, the <strong>reef</strong>s have been undergoing something called Coral Bleaching. The algae dies off, and the sun <em>chars</em> the coral, leaving nothing but a barren wasteland that looks like <em>charred rock</em>. The color is gone and all you have left is bone-dry, white <em>rocky charred</em> stuff.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/libsrone">libsrone</a>] 6-5-2008(25): A turkey gets stoned on<strong> reef</strong>ers to prepare itself for the oblivion of the oven.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint">Clint</a>] 16-7-2008(14): This character illustrates ancient ideas about the origin of coral <strong>reefs</strong>. Although we now know that coral are in fact marine organisms, the ancients thought that <strong>reefs</strong> looked like a gigantic pile of <em>stones</em> that had been <em>charred</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 16-1-2008(12): <strong>Reef</strong>s are made when the charred turkeys are thrown into the sea. They solidify like rocks and provide places for sea life to live.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 4-5-2008(11): A<strong> reef</strong> can be as hazardous as a jagged <em>rock</em> - if you hit one, your goose (er, <em>turkey</em>) is <em>cooked</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 12-6-2008(5): The Great Barrier<strong> Reef</strong> is dying as coral turns into <em>charred stone</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 12-7-2007(5): Imagine Johnny Utah, aka Keanu, saying with his impeccable acting skills &quot;Look out for that<strong> reef</strong> dude, those <em>rocks</em> on the left will leave you <em>charred</em>.&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 2-5-2009(4): [random]The retard came swimming up from the bottom of the<strong> reef</strong> with a perfectly normal <em>stone</em> in his hand. &quot;C-C-C- CAPTAIN, LOOK AT WHAT I FOUNDED! IT&#039;S <em>CHAR</em>COAL!&quot; screamed the retard. Knowing that this was just one of the retard&#039;s retardgasms, the captain just chucked the anti-retard <em>stone</em> at him, knocking him out cold, and returned to dumping the <em>char</em>coal in the coral <em>reef</em> to destroy it.[/random].
