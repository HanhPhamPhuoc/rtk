## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 25-2-2007(167): Fact: this kanji is used to denote a certain class of vehicles in Japan whose engines are under a certain size (less than 750cc I think) and are called <strong>light</strong> vehicles here. Imagine a so-called <strong>light</strong> vehicle or a <strong>light</strong>-truck with a load of <em>spools</em> driving down a road ever so<strong> lightly</strong>, careful not to let any of the <em>spools</em> roll out onto the street.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paddy71">paddy71</a>] 2-2-2008(119): I want to tread<strong> lightly</strong> on the environment.... That&#039;s why I CAR-SPOOL to work everyday.... I know, lame.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-2-2008(94): Suggestion: Replace &quot;spool&quot; with &quot;toilet paper/roll&quot;. Reason: See my note at <a href="../715">stalk</a> (#715 茎). Story: You are fussy about your <em>car</em> and to clean it you will only dab it very<strong> lightly</strong> with <em>toilet paper</em>. Spool also appears in <a href="../715">stalk</a> (#715 茎), <a href="../716">suspicious</a> (#716 怪), <a href="../882">diameter</a> (#882 径), <a href="../1360">sutra</a> (#1360 経).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 28-7-2008(56): I&#039;m such an infamously bad driver, even if I press the car&#039;s gas peddle<strong> lightly</strong>, everyone soils their pants.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 19-11-2008(21): Car made out of toilet paper would be very light.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xxinde">xxinde</a>] 8-10-2009(17): As Johnnyltn poited out, this character is used to denote a class of <strong>light</strong> <em>vehicles</em> (kei-<em>cars</em>) that, compared to other cars, are<strong> lightly</strong> taxed. Imagine this extremely light kei-car that gets its propulsion from a rubber band wound on a <em>spool</em> (like some toys) rather than a petrol engine. Also, &#039;lightweight&#039; would&#039;ve been a better keyword.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 5-8-2008(10): Move the car<strong> lightly</strong>! Or else I&#039;ll crap my pants again.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 29-10-2007(10): Having <em>soiled underwear</em> in a <em>car</em> is nothing to take<strong> lightly</strong>!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deborah">Deborah</a>] 13-11-2007(8): A class of <em>CAR</em> in Japan which you must drively<strong> lightly</strong> as its wheels are tiny <em>SPOOLS</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-8-2007(8): I <strong>lightly</strong> place <em>soiled underwear</em> in my friend&#039;s <em>car</em> as a prank.
