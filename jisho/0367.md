## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 7-8-2007(158): Japanese festival <em>floats</em> are often so tall they need <em>wood</em> <strong>scaffolds</strong> to be completed. (<a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5909.html">http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5909.html</a>). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 23-4-2007(34): You need a<strong> SCAFFOLD</strong> made of WOOD to build a FLOAT if it will be several stories high. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RachelleUdell">RachelleUdell</a>] 18-7-2008(30): HINT: Near as I can tell from the Zhongwen site, the figure that Heisig designates as a &quot;float&quot;, actually means &quot;lances broken into pieces&quot; (though there&#039;s a third stroke in the Japanese version of the kanji rather than two in the Chinese), thus I&#039;m using <em>broken into pieces</em> to identify that particular pictograph. STORY: A<strong> scaffold</strong> is made of <em>WOOD BROKEN INTO PIECES</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 7-7-2008(15): Not using Heisigs float. im extending the meaning of my Spear (see previous kanji).Think a VERY LONG SPEAR/TRIDENT (Trident as this is like an ARROW with 3 spikes) or, a LONG SPEAR because its just a SPEAR with TWO extra arrow lengths. STORY:<strong> SCAFFOLD</strong>s&#039; are made of VERY LONG SPEARS&#039;s as tall as TREES that allow us to build huge structures.Tridents allow TRIPLE interlocking between each other, making their use in<strong> SCAFFOLD</strong>S good enough to be able to build structures as strong and naturally perfect as TREES. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtstutz">dtstutz</a>] 5-9-2008(10): A<strong> scaffold</strong> is where you hang witches. In order to know whether they&#039;re witches or not, you put them on a scale to see whether they whether they weigh more than <strong>wood</strong>, a duck, or other things that <strong>float</strong>, like very small rocks. (Monty Python: Search for the Holy Grail). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alantin">alantin</a>] 14-5-2007(9): Tree - Float &quot;A float&quot; also means &quot;a decorated vehicle or platform used in a festival or parade&quot;. Here we are shown something important about making a proper float for your fiesta. It needs to have atleast three floors so you need to make a decent<strong> scaffold</strong> out of <em>wood</em> before you can start building the <strong>float</strong> for the <em>fiesta</em>! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/colonel32">colonel32</a>] 10-12-2006(5): Marie Antoinetto-sama is being taken to the <em>wooden</em><strong> scaffold</strong> (the guillotine) on a <em>float</em> through the streets of Paris. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 30-9-2009(3): In medieval times, people gathered around<strong> scaffold</strong>s to witness death penalties. Imagine a morbid show, each wooden float being a<strong> scaffold</strong> with its prisoner being put to death, one by hanging, another by burning, the next by decapitation... 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ecdrewello1">ecdrewello1</a>] 27-7-2012(2): Interesting to note that an old form of this character is 棧 which builds two lances together. If you are having issues with this and don&#039;t like the Heisig name for the primitive, think of this as   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/二">二</a>   (two) 戈 (lances). I used the <em>wood</em> from <em>two lances</em> to make a<strong> scaffold</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stan_in_japan">stan_in_japan</a>] 9-5-2012(2): A <em>wooden</em><strong> scaffold</strong> is often used to steady a <em>float</em> for the fiesta. (<strong>Float</strong>: build the float so that   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/二">二</a>   can carry it from under the top bar, for the fiesta).
