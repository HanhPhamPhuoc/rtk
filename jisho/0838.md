1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 15-10-2006(233): Even though it is argued size is not important, I&#039;m sure most women would like their<strong> husband</strong> to have a <em>big one</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 25-2-2007(72): Homer Simpson, as a primitive. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint">Clint</a>] 22-10-2008(21): After marriage, most men let themselves go a bit, and the result is predictable: <em>one large</em><strong> husband</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 9-6-2006(18): My <em>husband</em> is sent from <strong>heaven</strong>, and his head still pokes out a little. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 10-12-2009(7): The bride of Frankenstein owns this kanji. It represents her<strong> husband</strong>: <em>large</em> with a long <em>bolt</em> through his neck.
