## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(183): You are given a <em>speech</em> about some serious mistakes of yours, and you have to <em>endure</em> the whole thing, because all you can do is<strong> acknowledge</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 11-6-2006(142): I never read the &quot;acknowledgements&quot; section of books or theses, because they are mostly just boring <em>words</em> that i must <em>endure</em> reading, before i can get to the interesting part. :).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 16-11-2005(82): You would think that most <em>ninjas</em> (see previous frame) would<strong> acknowledge</strong> each other&#039;s presence with something like a silent nod. Imagine the consequences if, while raiding an enemy castle, one stupid <em>ninja</em> chose to<strong> acknowledge</strong> another by <em>saying</em>, &quot;HELLO!!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 9-12-2008(33): In Japan, people who make efforts to <em>endure</em> (gaman) can expect to receive <em>words</em> of<strong> acknowledge</strong>ment at some point. The ability to <em>endure</em> is so valued and respected in Japan that <strong>acknowlegement</strong> of some sort is virtually inevitable.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Medeo">Medeo</a>] 19-6-2009(25): Some Oscar winners go on far too long with their acceptance speech. But we are expected to politely ENDURE their endless stream of WORDS as they<strong> acknowledge</strong> their colleagues and loved ones.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas">amthomas</a>] 22-4-2007(20): <strong>Acknowledge</strong>ments are <em>words</em> that <em>endure</em>; as strong as a blade stuck in someone&#039;s heart.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 26-9-2007(16): If you keep <em>talking</em> to her and <em>endure</em> her rejection, eventually she will<strong> acknowledge</strong> you.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 6-6-2009(14): WORDS that ENDURE are the ones that get<strong> acknowledge</strong>d.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delbertmon">delbertmon</a>] 4-1-2010(7): The <strong>words</strong> of those who have <strong>endured</strong> extreme hardship and trials (like a blade through the heart) should be<strong> acknowledge</strong>d.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/killtheclock">killtheclock</a>] 6-2-2009(7): Wenn die Verdienste langjähriger Vereinsmitglieder <strong>anerkannt</strong> werden muß man viele <em>Worte</em> <em>erdulden</em>.
