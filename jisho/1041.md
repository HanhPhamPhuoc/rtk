## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 30-1-2006(96): If <em>Mr T</em> was <em>white</em> I am sure he would have been commander in<strong> chief</strong> of the USA, he just the sort of clown Americans love to vote for. (NB: I tried with the indian<strong> chief</strong> motif but kept adding feathers by mistake).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(63): <em>Mr T</em> was originally supposed to be the<strong> chief</strong> of the A-Team, but then the producers realized that America didn&#039;t want to see a Black guy as the<strong> chief</strong> of a prime-time TV show. So here, we see <em>Mr T</em> doing a bunch of <em>cocaine</em>, and then spreading it all over his face to look <em>white</em>, and trying out for the part of Hannibal. The directors were so impressed that they let him stunt double for Hannibal in a few episodes. OR, <em>Mr T</em> <strong>chief</strong>in&#039; on some <em>crack cocaine</em>. You make the call.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dinmamma">dinmamma</a>] 16-8-2009(39): OMG that kanji is racist!!! It shows the<strong> chief</strong> as a <em>white person</em>!!! Let&#039;s change it!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 13-11-2007(15): This also means <strong>Count</strong>... <strong>Count</strong> <em>Dracula</em>, the<strong> chief</strong> vampire, is easily recognized by his pale <em>white</em> skin, gleaming <em>white</em> fangs, <em>white</em> shirt, <em>white gloves</em>, et cetera.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 16-11-2008(14): Only the <em>jedi</em><strong> chief</strong> gets to use a <em>white</em> lightsaber.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 1-9-2008(8): <em>Haruhi</em> always wears something <em>white</em> to show she is the<strong> chief</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 26-5-2007(8): MR T needs to disguise himself as an indian<strong> chief</strong> so he grabs a dove and rips its feathers out and stiks them oh his head. Here he is chomping on the bird sat outside a wigwam.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 12-4-2010(7): MR T sends a WHITE DOVE to the Indian<strong> CHIEF</strong> as a sign of peace.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anragreg">anragreg</a>] 23-6-2009(7): Among his many honors, Chuck Norris is the first <em>white</em> indian<strong> chief</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 24-1-2009(7): (modified from Perry): MR T sends a WHITE DOVE to the Indian<strong> CHIEF</strong> as a sign of peace, because the <a href="../v4/963">transmit</a> (#963 伝) doesn&#039;t seem to have worked.
