## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 27-8-2007(223): Think of<strong> REGULARITY</strong> in terms of bowel movements. Enough WHEAT in your diet will help your DROPS with improved<strong> REGULARITY</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 7-5-2008(125): Eating plenty of <em>wheat</em> will improve<strong> regularity</strong> and help you <em>lose</em> weight.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 13-12-2008(67): I got it.<strong> Regularity</strong>, order, system, systematic. Now, Imagine the husband (the &#039;head&#039; of the household, the farmer and what not). Walking across his farm, then in a regular, ordered, and systemised fashion he DROPS (the drop) a little piece of wheat. I love this image not only because it answers the keyword, but it is really close to the meaning of the actual kanji.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 29-4-2007(31): Increase your<strong> regularity</strong> by eating <em>wheat</em>-bran <em>cereal</em> to improve the<strong> regularity</strong> of your <em>drops</em> in the bathroom.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eieneverafter">eieneverafter</a>] 6-4-2008(23): Farmers deal with <em>losing</em> some of their <em>wheat</em> as a <strong>regularity</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 13-7-2008(10): Wheat + Lose: If you don&#039;t eat wheat or fiber frequently you will lose<strong> regularity</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 30-4-2009(9): This does NOT mean periodic/occurring with normal frequency. The meaning of<strong> regularity</strong> Heisig was going for is &quot; evenly or uniformly arranged&quot;. I just changed this to <strong>well-ordered</strong> to decrease confusion. If your <em>wheat</em> is not <strong>well-ordered</strong>, you will <em>lose</em> a lot of it. &quot;No where&#039;s that <em>wheat</em> harvest from 6/23/06...I really should make my <em>wheat</em> <strong>well-ordered</strong>&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 17-12-2007(9): A peasant farmer walking the fields planting his <em>wheat</em>. He squats and &quot;<em>drops</em>&quot; a load every inch or so with great <strong>regularity</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ueshiba">ueshiba</a>] 6-8-2009(4): The farmer loses wheat during harvest, theres no way he can avoid it. It happens with such<strong> regularity</strong> that he doesn´t care anymore.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kresobilan">kresobilan</a>] 13-3-2008(4): <strong>Regular</strong> procession of seasons. After we cut the <em>wheat</em> in summer, trees <em>lose</em> the leaves in autumn.
