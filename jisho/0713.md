2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 12-9-2008(37): Your<strong> imminent</strong> introduction ( 挨拶 ）this EVENING has you nervous, biting your FINGERS, with a FLOOD of sweat raining down from your brow.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 18-11-2008(17): Because I knew that her FLOOD would be<strong> imminent</strong>, I tried to FINGER her a last time that EVENING.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 19-10-2008(11): I lick my <em>finger</em> and hold it up... a <em>flood</em> in the <em>evening</em> seems<strong> imminent</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 6-11-2011(10): Stop the FINGER pointing, the FLOOD was<strong> IMMINENT</strong>, we have to get out of here before the EVENING comes.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 21-10-2010(7): 挨拶 , 挨拶状 , <a href="../2261">imminent</a> (#2261 拶) aisatsu ... Parts:扌, ⼮, 夕 ... Note: Inane keywords for both 挨 <a href="../2248">shove</a> (#2248 挨) and 拶 <a href="../2261">imminent</a> (#2261 拶). Both used only for the word 挨拶 Aisatsu. (and Compounds) . Line both keywords up together. 挨 <a href="../2248">shove</a> (#2248 挨) this keyword, and put <em>Darts in from Elbow to Fingers</em>. Then<strong> Imminent</strong> pain makes you pull them out with your <em>Fingers</em> and bathe them in <em>Ku-ku-cool</em> <em>Ice Satsu</em> (get it? Aisatsu?) all <em>Evening</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 3-4-2011(6): Following the Sendai earthquake, a reporter furiously punched away at the keyboard with her <em>fingers</em> as she typed her report for the <em>evening</em> paper: &quot;<em>Flood</em><strong> Imminent</strong>!&quot; Unfortunately, the city was inundated before the evening paper made its rounds.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/barbouraj">barbouraj</a>] 4-1-2012(5): 挨拶 「あいさつ、Greeting」A cataclysmic <em>flood</em> is<strong> imminent</strong>, but because it is <em>evening</em> everyone is going to bed/asleep and doesn&#039;t realize. So you go from house to house knocking on doors and using your <em>fingers</em> to hurry through <strong>greetings</strong> and tell everyone that the <em>flood</em> is <em>imminent.</em> See Jonathan Swift&#039;s poem &quot;Description of a City Shower&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 22-1-2012(4): The word that you will sure see with this kanji is AISATSU (greeting) 挨拶 , so I rename them as AISATSU1 and AISATSU2 , as they have nothing to do with &quot;shove&quot; or &quot;imminent&quot;. Story: Because I knew that her FLOOD would be<strong> imminent</strong>, I tried to FINGER her a last time that EVENING, however she refused and bowed as an AISATSU. tks kuma.
