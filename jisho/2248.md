## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-5-2007(53): In the busy pub, one of the <em>dart</em> players<strong> shove</strong>d his dart into my <em>elbow</em> by accident when it nearly slipped out of his <em>fingers</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 3-1-2009(26): Your <em>fingers</em> slip when someone&#039;s <em>elbow</em><strong> shove</strong>s you, causing you to drop the <em>dart</em> you were about to throw. But as you can see, their elbow is very small, so you decide they&#039;re too weak to<strong> shove</strong> back. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 12-9-2008(22): You&#039;re scared to do your introduction (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/挨拶">挨拶</a>  ）, so a giant FINGER appears to<strong> shove</strong> you in front of the class. You land on your ELBOW, and the class shoots DARTS at you for falling. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peacemik">peacemik</a>] 16-6-2010(15): (+astridtops) In the crowded bar, someone<strong> shove</strong>s an <em>elbow</em> into you just as you are about to throw your <em>dart</em>. The <em>dart</em> slips from your <em>fingers</em>. You are just about to curse at the person when you realize that she is your Japanese teacher. You bow and greet [  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/挨拶">挨拶</a>   (あいさつ): greeting, salutation] her instead.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/挨拶回り">挨拶回り</a>   (あいさつまわり): New Year courtesy calls   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/挨拶状">挨拶状</a>   (あいさつじょう): greeting card. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kaame">Kaame</a>] 13-9-2012(7): I <strong>shoved</strong> him with my <em>fingers</em>. Then he <strong>shoved</strong> me with his <em>elbow</em>. Then I threw <em>darts</em> at him. Then he killed me :-(. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 5-7-2011(5): This kanji means to &quot;push open&quot; especially in terms of greetings so I titled this kanji &quot;Greeting&quot;. I am a little shy and don&#039;t like to talk so, I peep my head into a room and throw <em>darts</em> into the <em>fingers</em> and <em>elbows</em> of my friends as a <strong>greeting</strong>. When that doesn&#039;t get their attention, I<strong> shove</strong> them.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/挨拶">挨拶</a>   【あいさつ】 -or greeting - means Pushing Open whatever is Imminent. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 21-3-2010(4): I gave the guy a<strong> shove</strong> with my <em>fingers</em> but he didn&#039;t pay any attention. So I gave him a<strong> shove</strong> with my <em>elbow</em>, still he ignored me. Finally I<strong> shove</strong>d a <em>dart</em> at him, which got his attention. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 19-10-2008(4): I tried to <em>pay</em> with a <em>poison dart</em> and they<strong> shove</strong>d me out the door. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mirnkaya">mirnkaya</a>] 14-4-2012(2): In Japan you&#039;re expected to <strong>PUSH OPEN</strong> the doors with your <em>fingers</em> not your <em>elbow</em>, and also not make a <em>dart</em> for the door, but rather say a greeting (   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/挨拶">挨拶</a>   あいさつ ) first (such as しつれいします). And as for that rude custom of yours of elbowing your way into public places <a href="../784">public</a> <span class="index">(#784 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/公">公</a>)</span> - just<strong> SHOVE</strong> it. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 3-2-2011(2): It might help on this one to disaggregate &quot;dart&quot;---you try with your <em>fingers,</em> you try with your <em>elbow</em>, but no amount of <strong>shoving</strong> will budge the <em>reclining St. Bernard</em> (should have thought of that before you shot him with the tranquilizer <em>dart</em>).
