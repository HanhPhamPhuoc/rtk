## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 15-11-2006(38): For deaf people, whose <em>ears</em> do not function properly, the<strong> interpretation</strong> of speech is often attained by using their <em>fingers</em> in sign language, and pay close attention to the <em>mouths</em> of others.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 16-5-2010(13): (NB: I use <strong>COLLECT</strong> for 揖 , per 2d edition of RTK3.) 揖 illustrates the steps to be followed to <strong>COLLECT</strong> survey responses door-to-door. First, use your <em>FINGER</em> to ring the doorbell. Second, use your <em>MOUTH</em> to give your shpeel. Third, use your <em>EAR</em>s to listen to the responses.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(7): I <strong>bow with hands clasped</strong>, my <em>fingers</em> holding the microphone (with an <em>opening</em> that&#039;s like an <em>ear</em> for receiving sound) after giving my own<strong> interpretation</strong> of the karaoke song.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 18-11-2010(4): 拝揖 , Place Names: 揖斐川 , 揖東郡 , <a href="../2263">interpretation</a> (#2263 揖) <strong>Collect</strong> イツ, い ... Parts: 扌, 口 , 耳 ... Odd Keyword: Exclusively a place name ... Similar Keywords: 釈放 <a href="../1908">explanation/interpretation</a> (#1908 釈), 説明 <a href="../499">rumor/explanation</a> (#499 説), 揖斐川 <a href="../2263">interpretation</a> (#2263 揖), ... Story: (Using newer RTK keyword <strong>Collect</strong>.) when <em>Ear</em> wax <strong>Collects</strong> in your <em>Ear</em>, you should use your <em>Finger</em> to dig it out and put it in your <em>Mouth</em>. At least that&#039;s my<strong> interpretation</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 9-6-2009(4): <em>Fingers</em>, the thief, has a weird <strong>collect</strong>ion. It&#039;s all <em>mouth</em>s on the top, and all <em>ear</em>s on the bottom. Nobody knows why he started to <strong>collect</strong> them.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 3-3-2008(4): (from astridtops) I&#039;m here to <strong>collect</strong> (2nd edition keyword) money for the deaf, people whose <em>ears</em> don&#039;t work. We are going to teach them to sign using their <em>fingers</em> and to lip read <em>mouths</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(3): I can do simultaneous<strong> interpretation</strong> by sticking one of my fingers in the speaker&#039;s <em>mouth</em> and another in the listener&#039;s <em>ear</em>. NOTE 1: Do not confuse keyword with no. 1073 &quot;translate&quot;. Memory aid: (in)terpretation = f(in)ger (in) mouth &amp; ear. NOTE 2: The mouth &amp; ear combination also appears in <a href="../2392">shingling</a> (#2392 葺), <a href="../2732">assemble</a> (#2732 輯).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kusterdu">kusterdu</a>] 16-2-2009(2): I not only COLLECT folk-tales (mouth and ear) but also the elaborate finger gestures that accompany them.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 10-7-2012(1): When someone <strong>bows with clasped hands</strong>, one<strong> interpretation</strong> is that he&#039;s showing respect. Another<strong> interpretation</strong> is that he&#039;s secretly sticking his <em>finger</em> in his <em>mouth</em> so he can stick it in your <em>ear</em> and give you a wet willy.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 18-2-2010(1): In RTK3 2nd ed, this kanji has keyword <strong>collect</strong> (compile/bring together). I&#039;ll use this to avoid confusion with <a href="../1908">explanation/interpretation</a> (#1908 釈). STORY: A medical research scientist is <strong>collect</strong>ing papers. He&#039;s trying to get his <em>fingers</em> on papers related to the <em>mouth</em> and <em>ear</em> (think along lines of ENT or &quot;ear, nose, throat&quot;). You must first gather/collect information in order to <strong>interpret</strong> it.
