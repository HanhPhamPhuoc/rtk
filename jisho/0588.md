## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 15-10-2007(326): Try to remember all those<strong> store</strong>s from Zelda that were inside caves and had fortune-teller like vendors.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu">kiisu</a>] 7-3-2008(72): The fortuneteller has a<strong> store</strong> in a cave.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 26-11-2006(25): The <em>cavemen</em> ask their <em>fortune-teller</em> about what the future will look like. He goes into a trance, and in it sees a convenience<strong> store</strong> - row after shiny row of completely incomprehensible products...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 10-12-2008(13): The first<strong> store</strong> was simply a <em>cave</em> used by a <em>fortune teller</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiddle">fiddle</a>] 10-7-2006(10): The<strong> STORE</strong> is in a CAVE run by a really annoying FORTUNE TELLER who just wants to predict your future, preventing you from actually being able to buy anything.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/biodafes">biodafes</a>] 6-12-2011(9): I kept mixing this up with shop until I found the phrase &quot;in<strong> store</strong>&quot; like &quot;what is in<strong> store</strong> for you in the future.&quot; Only the<strong> store</strong> ran by the fortune teller can tell you what is &quot;in<strong> store</strong>&quot; for you,.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson">smujohnson</a>] 21-7-2008(9): A lot of<strong> store</strong>s are finding ways to compete with other<strong> store</strong>s. So far, the best<strong> store</strong> I&#039;ve seen is the one that attracts customers with it&#039;s mysterious <em>cave</em> entrance with the promise that you&#039;ll get a free <em>fortune-read</em> with every visit!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 16-3-2010(6): The oldest profession may be prostitution, but the oldest<strong> store</strong> was likely a pharmacy run by a <em>foretune teller</em> in a <em>cave</em> that sold potions and predictions of fate.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joshbeoulve">joshbeoulve</a>] 23-8-2009(5): Imagine a<strong> store</strong> in a <em>cave</em>, with a <em>fortune teller</em> as its attendant. She looks up from her crystal ball, cackles and greets you in an ever so creepy and mysterious tone - &quot;Irasshaimase...&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 9-10-2005(5): Does anyone else remember the witches in the original Zelda? They&#039;d have their magical<strong> store</strong>s set up in some cave. Wasn&#039;t there one that was supposed to be a forture teller and could give you hints on where to go next, or was that some other game? Oh well, it&#039;s in Zelda now. ;P.
