heisig: "A person of <b>discriminating</b> intellect can tell the difference between mere <i>kazoo</i>-buzzing and <i>words</i> spoken wisely. kazoo(toy instrument making sound) This primitive’s special usefulness lies not in its frequency but in its simplification of a few otherwise difficult kanjis. It piclesson tures the sound of a fiesta, namely a kazoo. Note how the element for sound is written first, the fifth stroke extended so that it can be used in the element for fiesta. [12]"

## Heisig story:

A person of <b>discriminating</b> intellect can tell the difference between mere <i>kazoo</i>-buzzing and <i>words</i> spoken wisely.

## Premitive:

kazoo(toy instrument making sound) This primitive’s special usefulness lies not in its frequency but in its simplification of a few otherwise difficult kanjis. It piclesson tures the sound of a fiesta, namely a kazoo. Note how the element for sound is written first, the fifth stroke extended so that it can be used in the element for fiesta. [12]

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas">amthomas</a>] 15-3-2007(261): <em>Words</em> are difficult to discriminate/discern from <em>sounds</em> in the middle of a <em>fiesta</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 14-2-2008(72): I have<strong> discriminating</strong> taste. I&#039;d rather listen to the <em>words</em> of a lecture than attend a <em>kazoo</em> concert. (Picture some snobby guy in a tweed jacket turning up his nose at entering a loud raucous kazoo recital).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 28-1-2007(59): I wonder why Heisig didn&#039;t use <strong>discernment</strong> for this kanji. It fits the meaning equally and it is not as loaded as <strong>discrimination</strong>. // It is quite hard to <strong>discern</strong> <em>words</em> in the middle of a <em>noisy fiesta</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 10-5-2009(14): <strong>Discriminating</strong> someone&#039;s <em>words</em> from other sounds is hard to do in the middle of a <em>noisy fiesta</em>. (Thanks esaulgd).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 31-8-2007(12): Socrates has apparently joined the KKK, and is actively<strong> discriminating</strong> against Black people. But to add a bit of artistic flair, as the ancient Greeks were wont to do, he says his racist words through a kazoo. <em>Socrates</em> humming the n-<em>word</em> through a <em>kazoo</em> - who would have thought?

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheesy_dave">cheesy_dave</a>] 4-11-2008(11): If you&#039;re a duck you need to be pretty<strong> discriminating</strong>. Its difficult to tell the difference between duck speech and a hunter&#039;s kazoo.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tom2000">tom2000</a>] 13-8-2010(10): Watching this World Cup in South Africa, I can&#039;t discriminate what the commentators are <em>saying</em> from the <em>Vuvuzela horns</em> (my version of the kazoo primative - the <em>sound</em> of this football <em>fiesta</em>!).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 7-2-2007(8): (NOTE: this word refers to intellect, not exclusion/racism). After delivering a fine evening <em>speech</em>, Socrates tried to impress his<strong> discriminating</strong> friends with his mad <em>kazoo</em> skillz, but they would have none of it. (Image: On the steps of the Parthenon: &quot;Nice speech Crates, really! And I love the kazoo, but, well...oh! look at the time! Gotta go!&quot;).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yuta73">Yuta73</a>] 2-5-2013(7): It&#039;s dificult to <strong>discriminate/discern</strong> what they <em>say</em> when everybody are playing the fiesta&#039;s <em>kazoos</em>. Don&#039;t confuse with 職 <a href="../824">post</a> (#824 職) or 差 <a href="../554">distinction</a> (#554 差) (It helps to think of <strong>discern</strong> in the understand sense).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yurypetrov">yurypetrov</a>] 20-5-2011(5): &#039;Knowledge&#039;, &#039;understanding&#039; is a more common meaning of this character. The right part of the character means &#039;watchtower&#039; (lance and sound signifying an armed watchman). Words from a watchtower signify knowledge, new intelligence.
