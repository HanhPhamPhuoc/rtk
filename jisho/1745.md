## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 13-2-2008(266): It&#039;s quite<strong> unusual</strong> and <strong>abnormal</strong> to see an <em>apple</em> with <em>walking legs</em> running away from the person who wants to eat it! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 3-12-2007(67): Imagine an <em>apple</em> on <em>walking legs</em> on stage singing &quot;It&#039;s not<strong> unusual</strong> to be loved by anyone&quot; (Tom Jones). Keyword can be confused with <a href="../1797">uncommon</a> <span class="index">(#1797 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/異">異</a>)</span>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 25-2-2007(61): It is<strong> unusual</strong> in the obese US to eat <em>apples</em> or to <em>walk</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 7-7-2006(42): In Japan, it&#039;s very<strong> unusual</strong> for people to eat whilst <em>walking</em> down the street. When Japanese people visit western countries and see someone eating an <em>apple</em> or a banana on the street, they find it very strange. This is true. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 1-10-2007(11): Sexual pervert   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/変態">変態</a>  （へんたい）<strong> Unusual</strong> behaviour? 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sekiei">sekiei</a>] 28-12-2012(8): In Japan it is<strong> unusual</strong> to <em>walk</em> and eat. When they visit Europe they think it is<strong> unusual</strong> that people eat <em>apples</em> and <em>walk</em> at the same time. They think is is further<strong> unusual</strong> when they go to America and no one ever eats <em>apples</em> or <em>walks</em> ...but the most frighteningly<strong> unusual</strong> of all is when they visit Soviet Russia and <em>apples</em> <em>walk</em> around eating you. This kanji pictures <em>apples</em> with <em>walking legs</em> doing just this. Can you blame them for isolation? 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-10-2005(8): Take the keyword meaning in the sense of &quot;abnormal&quot; to keep it distinct from &quot;rare&quot; and &quot;strange&quot;. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 21-6-2010(5): I see this is the rather<strong> unusual</strong> talking glass of <em>red</em>, <em>apple</em> flavoured Kool-Aid from Family Guy, walking in on his <em>walking legs</em> saying &quot;Oh Yeah!&quot; at the most inoppotune moments. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 24-7-2009(4): I changed this keyword to <strong>abnormal</strong>, as to not confuse with <a href="../1797">uncommon</a> <span class="index">(#1797 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/異">異</a>)</span>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jure23">jure23</a>] 2-4-2012(3): In Japan it is<strong> unusual</strong> to <em>walk</em> and eat. It is also<strong> unusual</strong> to eat <em>apples</em> that are not cut into pieces. (In Japan its also<strong> unusual</strong> to eat raw carrots, to eat the skins of grapes, to blow your nose in a hankercheif, to blow your nose in a tissue in public, to walk into a house with shoes on, to be very blunt or frank when your talking....
