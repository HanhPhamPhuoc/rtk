## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackhuddleston">jackhuddleston</a>] 3-5-2008(76): To me, this looks like a bridge<strong> going</strong> over a body of water, being supported by columns underneath it. Being that I live near the ocean, I see tourists and vacationers coming and<strong> going</strong> constantly on the bridge. Because the bridge is so long, it forms an arc to support the structural integrity. You can see that arc here.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 4-11-2005(53): I use <em>The Flash</em> for for this primitive; a superhero who is always <em>going</em> very fast.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(32): See book. * As a primitive I will prefer to use the meaning of column whenever possible, and use the image of columns of the temples of ancient Greece (such as Corinthian columns). The primitive meaning of line is best avoided in my opinion because it is very close to FRAME 812 “file”.<strong> Going</strong> is not very graphic, but may be used when a mnemonic calls for it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 8-9-2007(30): For those who need a mnemonic in order not to forget how to write this kanji, think of katakana イテ <em>ite</em> (here the イeven gets a dot): <em>ite</em> in Latin means <em>go</em>! +++ As for the primitive: I&#039;ll use <em>i</em> as in <em>iTunes</em> or <em><strong>i</strong>tinerary</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 4-3-2009(12): I was having a hard time using &#039;columns&#039; and &#039;going&#039; for the left-side later on. What helped me was using it as &quot;crossing the line&quot;. You know, as in &quot;going too far&quot;. This might help, it did for me.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 9-11-2008(6): When I look at this kanji, I see a broken bridge - the leftmost strokes representing the part of the bridge that has actually been damaged due to an earthquake or something. Imagine<strong> going</strong> across a bridge, when suddenly an earthquake tears the bridge in two.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 14-12-2006(6): Reading PepeSeco&#039;s story for <a href="../887">indications</a> (#887 徴), <em>Lance Armstrong</em> immediately came to mind. The connection with <strong>going</strong> (cycling, competition), <em>line</em> (the pack) and <em>column</em> (his straight back) are easily made. The <em>boulevard</em> here is of course the Champs Elysées, where the Tour traditionally ends. Yellow jersey though, didn&#039;t care much about becoming mountain king, but that&#039;s a minor distraction. ;).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac">aphasiac</a>] 4-8-2009(5): <em>The Flash</em> is always<strong> going</strong> the wrong way!Uh-oh, He&#039;s<strong> going</strong> down a <em>one</em> way <em>street</em>...Stop him!!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 19-4-2008(5): Sometimes the Heisig method drives me crazy...did we really have to learn 872 kanji before we got to &#039;iku&#039;!?!???...sorry, venting. For the left-hand primitive I have the Apple &quot;i&quot; (as in iPod, iPhone, etc.) Here we have the <em>iStreet,</em> the apple product you&#039;ll need while<strong> going</strong> down <em>one street.</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sabretou">sabretou</a>] 16-1-2011(3): To me this kanji looks like an elevated freeway, in 3D.
