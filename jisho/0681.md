heisig: Whatever one is particularly adept at - one's special "<b>genius</b>" - one can do very easily, "with one finger" as the phrase goes. This kanji is a pictograph of that one finger. Note how its distinctive form is created by writing the final stroke of the element for <i>fingers</i> backwards.
