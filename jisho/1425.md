This was the first time I&#039;d ever sent paper mail and I was in my mid 20&#039;s too. I was given a<strong> stamp</strong> and an envelope and was directed towards the postbox. But, I didn&#039;t know what to do with the<strong> stamp</strong>. I had a hard time believing that just licking it would keep it stuck to the envelope. So I <em>stapled</em> the<strong> stamp</strong> instead knowing it would hold better.
