The sense of <b>land</b> carried by this kanji is distinct from <i>soil</i> (Frame 161) and <i>ground</i> (Frame 554) in that it is meant to represent <b>land</b> seen from a distance, that is, <i>land</i> as opposed to &quot;water.&quot; Its elements: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>rice seedlings</i> . . . <i>ground</i>.

## Premitive:

rice seedling As we mentioned back in FRAME 234 苗, rice seedlings get an element all their own: soil and man legs becomes an ideograph of the spikelets of rice bunched together for implanting in the muddy soil of the paddy. [5] The sense of land carried by this kanji is distinct from soil (FRAME 150 土) and ground (FRAME 515 地) in that it is meant to represent land seen from a distance, that is, land as opposed to ""water.""

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 11-4-2006(162): My rice-seedlings have become sentient and will go on a mission. I can only apologise for the next 6 frames. In the distance, there is a <em>pinnacle</em>, which the newly-awakened <em>rice-seedlings</em> who are still stuck in the <em>ground</em> can see. Could it be the Promised<strong> Land</strong>?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 23-7-2006(90): When sailors see<strong> land</strong> in the distance, they first see the <em>pinnacles</em> of the new<strong> land</strong>, but when they come close enough they&#039;ll be able to make out the <em>rice seedlings</em>, and finally the <em>ground</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 23-7-2009(70): (圥 is the rare kanji for a mushroom. Sticking out of the <em>ground</em> like little knubby <em>legs</em>, it&#039;s pretty easy to remember.) Story ~ The<strong> land</strong> around <em>The Pinnacle</em> has <em>mushrooms</em> covering the <em>ground</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 19-3-2008(46): Primitive: Soil covered human legs is the result of planting rice seedlings into rice paddies all day. Poor rice farmers!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nagisa">nagisa</a>] 4-2-2008(32): The Pinnacle&#039;s<strong> land</strong> is so valuable that they cannot afford to let a single rice seedling be planted in the soil.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 12-6-2010(22): Everyone is saying that &quot;rice seedling&quot; is actually a mushroom, and it has legs, so I&#039;m making it a Goomba from the Mario games. Also, GOOMBA + GROUND = Mushroom Kingdom. This creates a lot of really great Mario based stories in the upcoming Kanji.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 12-7-2008(22): Sorry, gotta create a new primitive here. For Earth and Human Legs, I&#039;m going with HOBBIT or FRODO BAGGINS. If soil is under him, he is FRODO of the SHIRE. If its walking legs, then it is FRODO and the FELLOWSHIP. So, the<strong> LAND</strong> was under assault by the PINNACLE in the east which housed Sauron. so FRODO of the SHIRE takes a trip to that cursed<strong> LAND</strong> (should bring to mind SOIL, and the people of the soil, HOBBITS).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 4-6-2009(18): Trivia: I don&#039;t understand why Heisig said that 圥 is <em>rice seedling</em>, while all sources I could find say it&#039;s a <em>mushroom</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 5-4-2009(15): I don&#039;t like the primitive rice seedling, since there are already rice, and rice grains... so legs underground = quicksand.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 2-3-2009(10): The <em>Pikmins</em> are still stuck in the <em>ground</em>, waiting for Olimar to direct them to the <em>Pinnacle</em>, the promised<strong> land</strong>.
