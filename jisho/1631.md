## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nmkohi">nmkohi</a>] 23-7-2006(233): Back in the day the people were so excited to get hold of the Sega<strong> genesis</strong> they looted the godown with sabers. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imojyochu">imojyochu</a>] 17-12-2008(84): I prefer to have girls <em>Godown</em> on my <em>sabre</em> to prevent unwanted<strong> GENESIS</strong> of babies............  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/創造">創造</a>  　そうぞう (creation). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atylmo">atylmo</a>] 5-2-2009(51): The<strong> genesis</strong> of my hatred of kanji learning is when you get so mad that you have to look up what a <em>godown</em> is, and you end up cutting the book (or even Heisig himself) up with a <em>saber</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela">Wakela</a>] 24-3-2007(29): In the story of<strong> Genesis</strong> Adam and Even were kicked out of the Garden of Eden. They had to &quot;go down&quot; out of the garden and the entrace was guarded with sabers to prevent their return. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 5-6-2007(22): God actually has everything ever conceived in a big <em>godown</em>: if you want to exist, you have to grab a <em>sabre</em> and fight your way out. Such is<strong> genesis</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 22-12-2008(17): Neon<strong> Genesis</strong> Evangelion: Using a <em>saber</em> to make the angel <em>go down</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 3-11-2007(15): <strong>Genesis</strong> is the first book of the Old Testament. You manage to find the original at a <em>godown</em>. Not being much of a fan of religion, you slice it to shreds with your <em>saber</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 6-3-2007(14): The <strong>gensis</strong> of the <em>East India Trading</em> company was actually in Indian <em>sabres</em>, prized throughout Europe. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 3-2-2008(11): <strong>Genesis</strong> is the first book of the Old Testament. You manage to find a copy at a <em>godown</em>, where you have gone for sinful underground sex-club entertainment. Not wanting to be reminded of religion while satisfying your urges, you slice the book to shreds with your <em>saber</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 29-11-2008(9): At the beginning of the video game era, people looted the godown to get a hold of a Sega<strong> Genesis</strong>. (thanks nmkohi). Many people sustained serious wounds [alternate meaning] in the process.
