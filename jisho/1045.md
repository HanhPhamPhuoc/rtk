## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 8-9-2007(220): Under their <em>banner</em>, volunteers are requesting<strong> alms</strong> for <em>scorpion</em> sting victims.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 3-1-2008(62): (Note: This kanji also has the meanings &quot;apply bandages/administer first-aid&quot;). With that sense, you see some poor man who has been stung by a <em>scorpion</em>, so you extract the blood and <strong>make bandages</strong> out of your <em>banner</em> to <strong>administer first-aid</strong> to him. The you take the man to an hospital and give him<strong> alms</strong> to pay for the cure.

Instead, he gets stung by a <em>scorpion</em>. Now he needs <strong>first aid</strong>. 施す (ほどこす) : to donate, to give, to conduct, to apply, to perform; 実施 (じっし) : enforcement, enact, put into practice, carry out, operation; 施行 しこう enforcement; 布施 ふせ<strong> alms</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 17-12-2008(7): This kanji actually means <strong>to apply bandages</strong>. I took the BANNER and wrapped it around wounded SCORPION from mortal kombat as though I was <strong>applying bandages</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abdul">abdul</a>] 6-4-2011(5): El componente <em>estandarte</em> muestra una bandera recostada moviéndose en dirección del viento. Aquí el vemos una campaña de <strong>limosna</strong> para víctimas de picaduras de <em>escorpión</em>, los voluntarios traen un <em>estandarte</em> que nos muestra su noble causa.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(5): <em>Bruce Banner</em> (The Hulk) is sitting in church. I pass the<strong> alms</strong> basket to him. A scorpion jumps out of the<strong> alms</strong> basket, and The Hulk fights it to the death, saving everyone in the church.

I.e., 也 means <em>creeps-inducing creepy-crawly critters</em>. De Roo extends it to represent social outcasts like &quot;lepers&quot; and other sufferers of &quot;contagious diseases&quot;. Story: these are <strong>ALMS</strong> delivered to a leper colony that is clearly marked off by <em>BANNER</em>s featuring a <em>SCORPION</em> (symbol for &quot;contagious disease&quot;).
