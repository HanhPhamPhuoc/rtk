## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 7-3-2007(201): The newspaper pages are hung on the <em>clotheseline</em> to dry and then cut down with a <em>sabre</em> to be <strong>publish</strong>ed.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 31-5-2007(93): The newspaper pages are hung on the <em>clotheseline</em> to dry. This gives the government a chance to censor the news: they cut up unwanted stories with a <em>sabre</em>. Therefore, only state-approved stories are <strong>published</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 20-6-2008(57): The author&#039;s work was so <em>dry</em> that he had to threaten the<strong> publish</strong>er with a <em>sabre</em> in order to get them to<strong> publish</strong> it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 22-7-2008(24): <em>Cut</em> and <em>dried</em> - yeah, that sounds like most of the drivel<strong> publish</strong>ed nowadays.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mclin">mclin</a>] 9-4-2009(18): I can&#039;t<strong> publish</strong> this. It&#039;s too <em>dry</em>. Don&#039;t you have any stories with people getting attacked with <em>sabre</em>s or something?

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 23-12-2008(10): Your deadline is up to<strong> publish</strong> your next piece. Your in a frenzy, because your pen has run <em>dry</em>, and at the last moment you decide to end it all with your <em>sabre</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/General_Maxon">General_Maxon</a>] 4-1-2010(8): (icamonkey) Some Japanese guy is in a frenzy to meet his deadline to<strong> publish</strong> his next piece. Suddenly his pen runs <em>dry</em>, but he knows what he must do. In true Japanese fashion he takes out his <em>saber</em> and refills the pen with his blood, dedicating everything to getting that piece<strong> publish</strong>ed.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 8-11-2007(6): In the history of man, <em>vampire</em>s have done everything in their power to keep one fact from being<strong> publish</strong>ed: that a simple <em>saber</em> can kill them. It is, after all, much easier to defend oneself against a wooden stake.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 5-7-2010(4): A very strict Japanese<strong> publish</strong>ing company: If you don&#039;t close the deal with the client, you get the sabre! So when something is<strong> publish</strong>ed, people celebrate, saying &quot;Dry sabre!&quot; (The sabre isn&#039;t going to have any blood on it).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 1-3-2009(3): His DRY wit, sharp and cutting as a SABER, was the reason he kept getting<strong> publish</strong>ed.
