## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 12-1-2008(241): 挟まる 【はさまる】 (v5r,vi) to get between; to be caught in; (P) Story: You know how in tokyo there are those really packed trains where train staff in gloves shove people in? Well imagine being<strong> sandwiched</strong> in so tight, that when the doors close, only your FINGERS are sticking out. The train staff have no choice... they must cut them off with SCISSORS =( snip snip..

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 3-3-2010(134): Fingers<strong> sandwiched</strong> between a pair of scissors. Don&#039;t move or else!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 21-12-2008(26): In Tokyo trains, they&#039;ve got a problem with chikan, or old men who &quot;accidently&quot; molest women while being<strong> sandwiched</strong> against them on crowded trains. So now, Japan has hired Edward scissorhands to cut off the fingers of the offenders. Being<strong> sandwiched</strong> together is no excuse for chikan!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 30-7-2007(17): (Being left-handed and always using right-handed scissors turned upside down) My <em>fingers</em> <strong>get caught/sandwiched</strong> in <em>scissors&#039;</em> finger holes.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 16-5-2007(9): Hannibal Lector cuts his victim&#039;s <em>fingers</em> off with a pair of <em>scissors</em> and then serves them to him<strong> sandwiched</strong> between two pieces of bread.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 26-5-2009(8): Etymology of right half = 夾 (Type 1 Phonetic) (be pressed between). Interesting? <a href="../1265">gorge</a> (#1265 峡) <a href="../1266">cramped</a> (#1266 狭) <a href="../1267">sandwiched</a> (#1267 挟). Very directly related to the meaning of these three kanji.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mirnkaya">mirnkaya</a>] 21-4-2012(6): Being CAUGHT IN the train<strong> SANDWICHED</strong> between two perverts the girl hold the <em>scissors</em> BETWEEN her <em>fingers</em> - should they try to grab her with their fingers or PINCH her she&#039;ll be ready to use those <em>scissors</em> on them...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 7-3-2009(6): Two pervs on train sandwhich a girl between them, they start using their fingers on her so she cuts them off with a pair of scissors, she&#039;s used to and ready for that kind of thing.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 25-7-2009(5): Edward Scissors has no fingers, he has a difficult time eating sandwiches.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 24-7-2008(5): For the radical on the right, I suggest using <em>zipper</em> instead of <em>scissors</em> (chosen by Heisig merely because it slighty looks like one). Imagining <strong>sandwiched</strong> <em>fingers</em> in a <em>zipper</em>-like fashion is so easy it doesn&#039;t need more details.
