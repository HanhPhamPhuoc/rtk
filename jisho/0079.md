heisig: "The picture here is of someone with a slab of <i>meat</i> dangling <i>by the side</i>, perhaps from a belt or rope tied around the waist. Think of it as an evil spirit in <b>possession</b> of one's soul, who can be exorcized only by allowing fresh <i>meat</i> to hang <i>by one's side</i> until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon departs.
