heisig: "The key word <b>somebody</b> was chosen to convey the double meaning of this kanji: body and person. Its composition is based on the <i>nose</i> (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for <i>oneself</i>). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of <b>somebody</b> with a prominent paunch."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 8-12-2006(230): <strong>Somebody</strong> was just looking for you. He had a long<em>nose</em> that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face. (greenapple,16-3-2006) The way to remember that this is some<em>body</em> rather than <a href="../1256">someone</a> <span class="index">(#1256 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/者">者</a>)</span> is that the story is full of <em>body</em> descriptions. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 16-3-2006(56): <strong>Somebody</strong> was just looking for you. He had a long nose that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 17-4-2007(28): Gang members sometimes mark themselves to show belonging, like by cutting their <em>nose</em> with a large <em>slash mark</em>. Why do they do it? To show that they are<strong> somebody</strong>. As a primitive, this character will mean <em>gang member</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 17-5-2008(15): <strong>Somebody</strong> with a stick pierced through their nose just came in here. I think they were from the Brazilian rainforest.

Note: horrible keyword. Synonym for   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/体">体</a>   ... Parts:   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/自">自</a>  , 丿 ... Story:Though   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/体">体</a>   has mostly the same meanings this one has more to do with the human body rather than the general idea of body.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/車体">車体</a>   is a car body for instance. So <strong>Some one&#039;s Body</strong> might be a better keyword, so :   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/自分ノ">自分ノ</a>  body. ...   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/熟語">熟語</a>  :   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/独身">独身</a>  ,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/身長">身長</a>  ,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/身に着ける">身に着ける</a>  ,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/全身">全身</a>  ,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/変身">変身</a>   ... cf:   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/発射">発射</a>  ,. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 4-2-2010(9): There are already too many people kanji, &quot;somebody&quot; is too abstract, thus I am calling this Japanese Sex Doll. Look at it, it has a perfect <strong>Nose</strong> et cetera. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dicedice">dicedice</a>] 5-11-2008(7): Captain falcon is<strong> somebody</strong> with a distinct <em>nose</em> and a very prominent paunch! Say falcon paunch while writing the last two strokes.
