heisig: "This character obliges us once again to make use of a Japanese key word for want of an English equivalent. It refers to an old unit of weight, equal to about 3.75 grams. The word is only slightly more useful in modern Japanese than cubits and kites are in modern English. Its primitives, if you look closely, are: <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>arm</i>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 2-9-2006(270): &quot;Dude! What happened to your arm! It&#039;s all bound up!&quot; &quot;Yeah man, it&#039;s a bummer... with my arm like this I can only lift one<strong> monme</strong>!&quot;. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 3-12-2007(57): &quot;Dude! What happened to your arm! It&#039;s all bound up!&quot; &quot;Yeah man, it&#039;s a bummer... with my arm like this I can only lift one<strong> monme</strong>!&quot; &quot;You&#039;ll never be able to use your dagger now!&quot; (adapted from ergerg). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ikeda_kat2007">Ikeda_kat2007</a>] 31-12-2007(52): In Jamaica: Hey <strong>mon, may</strong> I have some (3.75 grams to be exact) uh dat leaf? I need it fo medical reasons. Look at my bound up arm! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 2-12-2008(37): Either Heisig or the person who put this on the list is an asshole. Most JP people have never seen it. Heisig admits is useless. I hope his arms get bound up by the police for carrying a<strong> monme</strong> of crack. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 24-9-2007(34): Very difficult to picture, however, a<strong> MONME</strong> is very light, only 3.75 grams. So, imagine your BOUND UP sore ARM. Now imagine the weight of the cloth that BOUND UP your ARM. Yep, you guessed it. It weighs one<strong> MONME</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kilioopu">kilioopu</a>] 27-9-2009(11): Children&#039;s game   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/花一匁">花一匁</a>  （はないちもんめ）hana ichi<strong> monme</strong>: each team <em>bind</em> their <em>arms</em> together. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 16-3-2008(11): I prefer to split this into   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/人">人</a>   and   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/刀">刀</a>  , even though the stroke order would suggest doing otherwise. <em>Person</em> is very pleased that his <em>katana</em> only weighs one<strong> monme</strong>. He waves it around approvingly. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ji_suss">Ji_suss</a>] 21-12-2008(10): This<strong> monme</strong> isn&#039;t <a href="../1049">not</a> <span class="index">(#1049 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/勿">勿</a>)</span>. This little piggy&#039;s leg got bent backwards. He shouted, &quot;Hey MON, ME leg got bent backwards!&quot;. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Marble101">Marble101</a>] 13-6-2012(9): This character was a Joyo Kanji when Hesig wrote his book, so that&#039;s why Hesig included it. This character is used so infrequently that it was dropped from the list in 2010. So if you don&#039;t learn it, you won&#039;t see any problems. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sdrobertm">sdrobertm</a>] 31-1-2011(5): A bound up arm can lift no more than a<strong> monme</strong>.
