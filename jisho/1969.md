## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 15-10-2006(178): <strong>Coding</strong> is a <em>tool</em> which you can use to <em>bend</em> the computer to your will.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vileru">vileru</a>] 8-1-2010(75): This kanji means a<strong> code</strong> of law, not a secret language or symbolic language (such as programming<strong> code</strong>) ... Story: The<strong> code</strong> of law is a <em>tool</em> used to <em>bend</em> citizens to society&#039;s will. You can use the image of a totalitarian state, but be careful not to confuse it with the pinnacle primitive <a href="../1294">Heights</a> (#1294 阪).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-7-2008(60): Think &quot;codex&quot; (mnemonic help) or &quot;code of laws&quot;, or even Leonardo Da Vinci&#039;s<strong> code</strong>. Here I see a<strong> code</strong>x as a <em>tool</em> used to <em>bend</em> the masses into submission. Picture a huge<strong> code</strong>x book lifted down on crowds to bend them down in submission. Another: if you <em>bend</em> to the<strong> code</strong> without asking questions, you are a <em>tool</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 8-7-2008(23): Bender can be used as a tool for bending. But only if you know the right<strong> code</strong> (He never does want you want to).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(20): <strong>Code</strong>/<strong>rules</strong> can be <em>bent</em> with the correct <em>tool</em>... (usually money).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-3-2007(12): The unwritten <strong>code</strong> is a strong <em>tool</em> used to <em>bend</em> the minds of the people to action.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 5-12-2007(10): Think of the Pirate&#039;s<strong> CODE</strong>. It&#039;s more of a guideline you can BEND, making it a useful TOOL for when you have to parlez!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scotty28">scotty28</a>] 14-12-2009(9): Bender can be used as a tool for bending. But only if you know the right<strong> code</strong>. The<strong> code</strong> is &quot;eat my shiny metal ass&quot; (or any other bender catch phrase to help you connect bender to<strong> code</strong>! thanks jotun).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(7): <em>Bender</em> is just a <em>tool</em> that follows<strong> code</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 5-7-2009(6): Fry accidentally input the<strong> code</strong> for bender to grow animal legs.
