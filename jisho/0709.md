## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inuki">inuki</a>] 16-1-2007(429): Your car has missles?! That<strong> beat</strong>s mine, hands down. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 9-1-2008(115): Think 3 methods of attack all combined into 1 kanji: 1. Vehicle to transport troops 2. Once troops have disembarked they have their missiles 3. If they run out of missiles they resort to hand to hand combat to<strong> beat</strong> the enemy. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kinkypete">kinkypete</a>] 11-1-2008(77): In a random version of rock,paper, scissors. A car is<strong> beat</strong>en by a missile that hits it, the missile is<strong> beat</strong>en by the hand that can type in the deactivation code (which in turn is<strong> beat</strong>en by the car that runs over it). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 15-6-2009(32): Dirty little young driver in his <strong>car</strong>, <strong>semen</strong> flies up in the air and hits his <strong>hand</strong> as he <strong>beats</strong> it. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 10-9-2008(14): I have three strategies to<strong> beat</strong> this guy. First I try to run him over with my car. If that fails I through missles at him. Finally, if that also doesn&#039;t work I simply use my hands to<strong> beat</strong> him up. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 5-5-2009(9): Your <em>car</em> has <em>semen</em>?! That<strong> beat</strong>s mine, <em>hands down</em>. [inuki tweaked]. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/strugglebunny">strugglebunny</a>] 27-9-2008(9): In Twisted Metal a <em>car</em> with homing <em>missiles</em> will<strong> beat</strong> most other players, <em>hands</em> down. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/leecha2">leecha2</a>] 22-7-2009(8): At the cost of getting reported: Imagine using a little <em>fire truck</em> (-&gt;<em>car</em>) to spatter <em>semen</em> over a girl&#039;s face. I guess you can already see her <em>hand</em> <strong>beating</strong> you in the face. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 5-6-2008(8): We will <strong>attack</strong> and<strong> beat</strong> you! First we will send armored <em>cars</em> and <em>missiles</em> by air. Whoever remains we will defeat via <em>hand</em>-to-<em>hand</em> combat. (Thx Genbaku) // If you have trouble with the keyword &#039;&#039;beat&#039;&#039; as I was: just think of &#039;beat off&#039; - I&#039;m sure you can see the story about a <em>hand</em> in a parked <em>car</em> - resulted in a (ahem) ... <em>missile</em> or projectile of some sort. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 21-8-2006(7): The major articles in a war used to<strong> beat</strong> your enemy: <em>vehicles</em>, <em>missiles</em> and finally <em>hand-to-hand</em> combat. It always comes down to <em>hand-to-hand</em>.
