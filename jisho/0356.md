heisig: "From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a <b>range</b> has also come to mean a grazing <i>land</i> where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming <i>fiesta</i> like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the <b>range</b>, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the <i>mouth</i> on the <i>floor</i>), and then get on with the <i>fiesta</i>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 10-10-2007(208): An astronaut lands back at the launch<strong> range</strong>, kisses the <em>earth</em> beneath him with his <em>mouth</em>, then heads off to a <em>fiesta</em> to celebrate a safe flight. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 23-7-2008(62): Instead of Heisig&#039;s &quot;Fiesta&quot; I use &quot;Spear&quot;. Why? A spear is just a DROP extra on an Arrow.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/域">域</a>  ,<strong> range</strong> actually means<strong> range</strong> as in limits/boundary/border sort of<strong> range</strong>(In a box it was the old meaning for Country  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/國">國</a>   (581). Ok way too much etymology here, but back to story. With your SPEAR standing in a HOLE on the FLOOR with SOIL to its left9as you dug some out), you can see the<strong> RANGE</strong> of the spear in attacking a possible enemy (re Diablo and other RPGs, spear&#039;s have<strong> range</strong>). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jHerbin">jHerbin</a>] 8-4-2010(30): When the <em>land</em> was within <strong>range</strong>, the pirates <em>kissed the deck</em> and had a <em>fiesta</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 19-2-2008(23): Dora and her party must travel over the<strong> range</strong> of earth, find the mouth of a cave on the ground, and then enter within to get to the fiesta. Remember: Land, Mouth on the ground, Fiesta! 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 27-11-2008(19): Dirty mexicans like to kiss the floor at the fiestas on the<strong> range</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 3-10-2008(13): An extra <em>drop</em> on an <em>arrow</em>? That&#039;s a <em>spear</em>, Heisig, not a fiesta! The extent of <em>land</em> that is within<strong> range</strong> of my <em>spear</em> is everything to me, I kiss it (<em>mouth</em> on <em>ground</em>). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher">tstuhldreher</a>] 30-5-2008(10): For a free<strong> range</strong> chicken, just putting its ONE MOUTH on the GROUND to peck at grain is like a FIESTA compared to all those poor factory-raised chickens stuffed in cages. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harhol">harhol</a>] 10-4-2009(9): I recall stealing a Ford FIESTA in my younger days and being involved in a high speed police chase. I drove through the GROUNDS of a golf course for several miles but my joyride eventually came to an end on the driving<strong> range</strong>, where a stray golf ball smashed through the windscreen, hit me in the MOUTH, knocked out ONE of my teeth and left me unconscious. Needless to say I haven&#039;t been to a driving<strong> range</strong> since. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JasonCRomero">JasonCRomero</a>] 7-9-2009(8): Out on the <strong>range</strong> in Brokeback Mountain the two cowboys <em>kissed</em> (made one mouth) on the <em>ground</em> and had their own <em>fiesta</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stevieman">Stevieman</a>] 17-3-2010(6): As liosama said the &#039;<em>fiesta</em>&#039; part in chinese means <em>lance</em> or <em>spear</em> (stake with a blade), the box is the primitive &#039;<em>pent in</em>&#039; or &#039;<em>enclosure</em>&#039; (primitive before <a href="../578">sayeth</a> <span class="index">(#578 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/曰">曰</a>)</span>) and the floor representing &#039;<em>ground</em>&#039;. All come together to represent a <em>lance</em> marking a <em>region</em> (like those spears with skulls tribes use to mark off their land) SO <em>region</em> + <em>ground</em> =<strong> range</strong> of a region. mnemonic: <em>spear</em> in <em>land</em> marks off <em>enclosure</em>/<strong>range</strong> of <em>land</em>.
