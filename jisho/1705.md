## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 13-4-2008(207): I spent some time in her TEEPEE...just the TWO of us...but I looked between her HUMAN LEGS and I saw a nasty<strong> DISCHARGE</strong>...so I made my   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/出発">出発</a>  　rather hastily. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 25-4-2008(101): <em>Two pairs of human legs</em> poking out of a <em>teepee</em>: you know there&#039;ll be a<strong> discharge</strong> soon, be it sexual, violent (husband returns home with a weapon), or dishonourable (soldier caught molesting a native), or perhaps all of the above. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-3-2007(61): The indian chief went into his <em>teepee</em> and found his wife sleeping with a cowboy. He <strong>discharged</strong> his gun at the <em>two</em> people, and left with their <em>legs</em> <strong>discharging</strong> out the door. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 27-1-2010(32): The soldier was dishonorably<strong> discharge</strong>d when his commanding officer saw <em>two pairs of legs</em> sticking out of a <em>teepee</em> designed for just one soldier. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lanval">lanval</a>] 14-4-2009(10): Hier sieht man den Akt, der neues Leben <strong>hervorbringen</strong> kann: Ein <em>Tipi</em>, und <em>zwei</em> Paar <em>Menschenbeine</em> ineinander verschlungen. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 30-12-2008(5): (I am sorry in advance for this one, but you have to admit, memorable) I had such a huge<strong> discharge</strong> that I had to hold the TP with both hands in order to clean myself... 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-12-2006(5): You see a teepee<strong> discharge</strong> human legs, two at a time. When you go peek inside, you see Indians performing some strange sacrificial ritual. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 11-6-2008(3): Indian women do not have to bear children anymore, they have received a magic <em>teepee</em> that<strong> discharge</strong>s babies for them. But wait, the magic <em>teepee</em> was not designed to<strong> discharge</strong> twins! Oh no, the babies are stuck, see the <em>two pairs of legs</em> stuck in the opening! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 9-5-2006(3): A native American soldier is<strong> DISCHARGE</strong>D from the army because of a terrible infection in his legs. He goes to see the medicine man from his local tribe who practices in a TEEPEE. Unfortunately, the prognosis was bad and he had to have his TWO HUMAN LEGS removed. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 9-10-2012(2): The primitive here is a form of <em>both hands</em> but with <em>human legs</em> instead. So I use <em>two legs</em>. I imagine lying down inside my <em>teepee</em> and using my <em>two legs</em>, <strong>launch</strong> it into the air to surprise passers-by.
