## Heisig story:

Flower . . . spool.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-2-2008(196): Suggestion: Replace &quot;spool&quot; with &quot;toilet paper/roll&quot;. Reasons: (1) <em>Toilet paper/roll</em> usually comes on a <em>spool</em>. (2) <em>Toilet paper</em> is used to clean the <em>soil</em> off your <em>crotch</em>. Story: Just get a <em>flower</em> and carefully wrap some <em>toilet paper</em> around its<strong> stalk</strong>. Spool also appears in <a href="../716">suspicious</a> (#716 怪), <a href="../717">lightly</a> (#717 軽), <a href="../882">diameter</a> (#882 径), <a href="../1360">sutra</a> (#1360 経).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-8-2007(130): PRIMITIVE: <em>soiled crotch</em> = <em>soiled underwear</em>. To precent anyone from picking the beautiful <em>flower</em>, the gardner hung <em>soiled underwear</em> on the <strong>stalk</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nac_est">nac_est</a>] 24-7-2007(83): A <em>flower</em>&#039;s<strong> stalk</strong> can be seen as connecting the <em>flower</em> to the <em>soil</em>, <em>or again</em> the <em>soil</em> to the <em>flower</em>. It depends on how you look at it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 15-10-2010(62): Jack and the Bean<strong>stalk</strong>: <em>dirt</em> below, <em>flowers</em> above, and Jack&#039;s <em>crotch</em> visible as he climbs up and up. 茎 (くき) :<strong> stalk</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 16-9-2007(30): Flowering vines growing up a post or column. The<strong> stalk</strong>s wrap around the post-- again and again-- like a <em>spool </em>of thread, and <em>flowers</em> bloom at the very top. At the bottom, of course, is the soil.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 14-10-2005(29): A very odd <em>flower</em> we have here, with a<strong> stalk</strong> (stem) so long, it curls round and round like a <em>spoo</em>l.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint">Clint</a>] 29-5-2008(21): A clever way to<strong> stalk</strong> someone: give them a beautiful <em>flower</em> with a <em>spool</em> of thread attached (to the<strong> stalk</strong>, of course!) so that as they walk, the <em>spool</em> slowly unwinds, leaving a trail of thread behind. Then, no matter where they go, you can simply follow the thread to wherever they are! Muahaha!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KeroHazel">KeroHazel</a>] 11-2-2009(11): The &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; references are great, but if you&#039;re a gamer I have something even better. Think Super Mario Bros. 2! Look at it as a pictograph. The <em>flower</em> is the top of a climbable vine. The <em>crotch</em> is the legs of your character. The bottom part is not soil but the bottom half of <em>ivy</em> - the top half is obscured by your character. Sing the music for the first level of this game when you study, and I guarantee you will never forget this one!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 29-10-2007(9): The <strong>stalk</strong>er took the<strong><strong> stalk</strong></strong>ee&#039;s <em>soiled underwear</em> and put them to his face, smelling them as he would smell a handful of <em>flower</em>s.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TalkTalk">TalkTalk</a>] 4-8-2009(6): Between its <em>flower</em> and the <em>soil</em> is the<strong> stalk</strong> (a/k/a the plant&#039;s <em>crotch</em>).
