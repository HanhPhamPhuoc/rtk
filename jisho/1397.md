heisig: "Different from the primitive for <i>sun</i> (which figures in the character) and the kanji for <i>ray</i> (Frame 125), the key word <b>sunshine</b> is meant to convey the meaning of the masculine principle in nature, or &quot;Yang.&quot; (The dark is viewed mythically as the feminine principle; see frame 1718.)

## Heisig story:

Different from the primitive for <i>sun</i> (which figures in the character) and the kanji for <i>ray</i> (Frame 125), the key word <b>sunshine</b> is meant to convey the meaning of the masculine principle in nature, or &quot;Yang.&quot; (The dark is viewed mythically as the feminine principle; see frame 1718.) From there it comes to mean <i>sun</i> also. The elements are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>piggy bank</i>.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-1-2006(191): A kid is perched on a <em>pinnacle</em> with his <em>piggy bank</em>. He uses the coins to catch the<strong> sunshine</strong>, and redirect it into people&#039;s eyes, far below.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 5-2-2007(77): <em>The Pinnacle</em> is environmentally friendly. They collect <strong>solar</strong> power through<strong> sunshine</strong> on their <em>piggybank</em> shaped solar arrays.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gibosi">gibosi</a>] 10-1-2007(65): At the Pinnacle, they use solar collectors, sun piggy banks, if you will, to capture the sunlight.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 13-4-2008(30): Mario<strong> SUNSHINE</strong>: collect enough shines to fill the PIGGY-BANK and the<strong> sunshine</strong> will issue forth from THE PINNACLE of Isle Delphino.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 19-3-2008(30): The pinnacle catches the<strong> sunshine</strong> like a piggy bank catches coins.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/altaya">altaya</a>] 9-7-2011(14): <strong>Sunshine</strong> was the nickname of Yang, an adorable local young boy who would climb the <em>pinnacle</em> every day to collect<strong> sunshine</strong> in his <em>piggy bank</em> for his ill sister Yin, who had to live in the <a href="../v4/1592">shade</a> (#1592 陰) (we&#039;ll meet her later).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 18-9-2010(11): <em>The Pinnacle</em> basks in<strong> sunshine</strong> every day because it is far above the clouds. Appropriately, it is the best place to install solar cells. The city exports its solar power to the lower world and fattens its <em>piggy bank</em> in the process.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 3-2-2009(5): From Fuaburisu&#039;s story: The kid&#039;s name is Yang and he is &quot;charging&quot; with solar energy his piggy bank (and coins). Meaning:<strong> sunshine</strong>, yang principle, positive...

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peacemik">peacemik</a>] 25-7-2008(5): Combining dingomick&#039;s &amp; gibosi&#039;s stories: <em>The Pinnacle</em> is environmentally friendly. They collect <strong>solar</strong> power with <em>piggybank</em>-shaped <strong>solar</strong> arrays (which are so shaped because they are<strong> sunshine</strong> <em>piggybanks</em>--they allow<strong> sunshine</strong> to be stored for later use). 太陽 (たいよう): sun 陽気な (ようきな): jovial, lighthearted, cheerful, vivacious, playful 陽子 (ようし): proton 陽子 (ようこ): Yoko (name) 陽極 (ようきょく): anode 陽イオン (ようイオン): cation.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kodorakun">kodorakun</a>] 27-1-2010(3): SUCCESS: Study fuaburisu&#039;s story for<strong> sunshine</strong>, immediately go study frame 1311, &quot;neighboring&quot; and desmidus&#039;s story matches perfectly. (it&#039;s the same boy causing problem in the pinnacle! he&#039;s a trouble maker).
