Cow . . . cell.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 8-1-2008(279): <strong>Animal sacrifice</strong> = taking the life of a cow.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 12-3-2007(71): In the 21st century,<strong> animal sacrifice</strong> is no longer really necessary. We can take a single cell from a cow, with no harm to the cow. We create a viable cell line from this single cell, and feed the resulting biomatter into a furnace at the exact rate necessary to appease the gods.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 20-12-2007(20): The whole <em>life</em> of a <em>cow</em> is like one big long<strong> animal sacrifice</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 5-1-2009(13): <em>Life</em> for a <em>cow</em> in India is pretty good. At least they would never be used as an animal scarifice.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 16-6-2008(13): There are two kanji that should be kept separate: <a href="../643">sacrifice</a> (#643 犠) ( 義 ), and this one. Think of it this way: in 義 there is a <em>cow</em> and a <em>righteous</em> person (presumably a Hindu). One must be <strong>SACRIFICE</strong>d, so naturally the righteous Hindu took the place of the holy cow. But as the Hindu is no longer alive to protect the cow, so we will now take the <em>cow&#039;s life</em> in an <strong>animal sacrifice</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 3-9-2007(8): (Image: <em>Frankenstein</em> tearing apart a <em>cow</em> in a gruesome <strong>animal sacrifice</strong>, lightning crashing above).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 31-10-2007(6): If you kill a <em>cow</em> or <em>Paris Hilton</em>, I&#039;m sure God would accept either as an<strong> ANIMAL SACRIFICE</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eatyoda">eatyoda</a>] 10-11-2008(5): Without <strong>animal sacrificing</strong> the <em>cow</em>, <em>Frankenstein</em> wouldn&#039;t have come to <em>life</em>. I imagine a transfer of life energy: a cow slowly dying as Frankenstein comes to life.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 3-7-2012(4): A <em>cow</em>&#039;s <em>life</em> lost by<strong> animal sacrifice</strong> (don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../643">sacrifice</a> (#643 犠)).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-10-2005(4): Have you ever heard of the cow mutilation phenomena associated with UFO&#039;s ? There were many cases of such &quot;animal sacrifice&quot; reported during the 50&#039;s but it is still going on today. Usually, the <em>cow</em> (or other animal) is found dead, with no real pathological cause for death, other than the surgically-precise removal of one of their organs (a patch of skin, tongue, eye, etc). Here a farmer complains, and rightly so, because those stupid aliens have sacrificed a poor <em>cow</em>, just to remove one <em>cell</em> !
