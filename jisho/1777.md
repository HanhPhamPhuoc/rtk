Rice . . . shelf.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/felicitygreen">felicitygreen</a>] 27-4-2006(185): Refined rice [1535] can only be found in exclusive grocery shops.<strong> Coarse</strong> <em>rice</em> by contrast fills the supermarket <em>shelves</em> - don&#039;t go looking for anything else there.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 22-3-2009(140): Ugh, why does this <em>shelf</em> feel so<strong> coarse</strong>? Because it&#039;s made of <em>rice</em>, of<strong> coarse</strong>! Get it? Of<strong> coarse</strong>?? Hahahahahahahahahah god i hate my life.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 30-12-2006(37): In America they sell<strong> coarse</strong> rice on the shelves. The Japanese are much more discriminating, as they eat rice all the time, so they want finer rice.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 22-2-2009(20): Japanese carpenters don&#039;t use sandpaper, they use rice-paper(rice glued on to some paper). Here the carpenter is using the<strong> coarse</strong> paper to smooth out the shelf he&#039;s making.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/firion1234">firion1234</a>] 18-3-2010(10): &quot;<em>RICE</em> is not nice,&quot; said the <em>CAT IN THE HAT</em>, &quot;it is much to<strong> COARSE</strong>, like food for a horse.&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 10-1-2010(6): A vibrating sorting device for <em>rice</em>. It consists of a series of <em>shelves</em>, each with holes progressively smaller than the one above. The <em>rice</em> is poured into the top and fine grains percolates to the bottom while<strong> coarse</strong> grains remain on top.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 7-2-2008(3): Japanese book <em>shelves</em> are sanded down with extremely fine-grain sandpaper, down to an almost impossibly smooth finish. On the other hand, <em>American</em> shelves feel much more rough and<strong> coarse</strong> by comparison, as they use<strong> coarse</strong>-grain sandpaper. The finished <em>shelf</em> still feels as<strong> coarse</strong> as raw lumber.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 8-2-2007(3): This is so <strong>coarse</strong>! Upon closer examination, it&#039;s made up of <em>rice</em> compressed into boards. This whole <em>shelf</em> is made of it.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 20-3-2011(2): I keep the<strong> coarse</strong> rice stored in the <em>rice cabinet</em>. (The fine stuff is stored in an airtight jar) 粗筋 (あらすじ) : outline, summary; 粗い (あらい) :<strong> coarse</strong>, rough; 粗末 (そまつ) : crude, rough, plain, humble.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mary_K">Mary_K</a>] 19-6-2009(2): Putting <em>rice</em> in my <em>shelf</em> has made it<strong> coarse</strong>.
