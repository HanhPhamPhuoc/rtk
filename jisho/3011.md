## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 25-12-2009(2): <strong>Mois</strong>: Mr.T won’t take any crap from his agricultural workers, “If you go’n complain, leave it all up to mois, fool!”.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gruuf">gruuf</a>] 5-10-2010(): <strong>Mois</strong>: Mr.T only calls himself 儂 (わし) in front of the <em>agricultural</em> workers (namely <em>Bender</em> and <em>Bruce Lee</em>) working for him. (儂 is a form of referring to oneself mostly used by older males towards younger people, can be seen as arrogant). (Thanks to thecite).
