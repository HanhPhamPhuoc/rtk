heisig: "This character pictures food whose taste is so hot and <b>spicy</b> that it makes the hairs on your body <i>stand up</i> as straight as <i>needles</i>. As a primitive, we shall use this meaning of spicy, except when the two extra strokes are added to the bottom, giving it the form of a tree: 1. Then we take its alternate meaning of a red pepper plant. The connection is obvious."
