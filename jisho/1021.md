## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 27-4-2008(497): Half Way!!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-6-2006(223): This is a &quot;<em>design</em>&quot; as in a &quot;pattern&quot;, not a verb as in &quot;to <em>design</em>&quot;. The <strong>tree</strong> grain <em>design</em> was too expensive for the <strong>third class</strong> airline to use for the panelling. They just painted it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 29-4-2008(200): Makes me think of Ikea. Everything is <em>wooden</em> and the<strong> design</strong> is really nice but the quality really is <em>third rate.</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 11-11-2005(58): The third class seats on the train are very simply<strong> design</strong>ed. In fact, they&#039;re not<strong> design</strong>ed at all. They&#039;re just wooden stumps of trees.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 12-4-2008(23): <strong>DESIGN</strong> makes me think of &#039;intelligent<strong> design</strong>&#039;, the <em>third class</em> alternative to evolution for the hard-of-thinking. You&#039;d have to have solid <em>wood</em> between your ears to believe it!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 16-10-2009(19): Ikea: Great<strong> design</strong>s, <em>third class wood</em>. My bookshelf is flimsy as heck! (thx AndamanIslander).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 18-12-2006(12): If you have the time, read this story: <a href="http://www.419eater.com/html/john_boko.htm">http://www.419eater.com/html/john_boko.htm</a> It&#039;s about a Nigerian scammer who got scammed himself. I picture him scrounging up cash to take a third class flight with his latest wooden sculpture<strong> design</strong> to ensure his package is delivered allright this time.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 3-4-2008(6): In<em>tree</em>rior<strong> design</strong> of the <em>third class</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark">mistamark</a>] 20-10-2008(5): The wooden<strong> design</strong> of the third class airline wasn&#039;t so nice.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spann0r">spann0r</a>] 13-5-2010(4): (Bearing in mind the second meaning of &#039;handle&#039; or &#039;hilt&#039;) Think of a martial arts nerd who pays top-yen for (what he thinks is) an antique <em>wooden</em> practice sword (bokken) with an intricate<strong> design</strong> carved into the handle in an Asakusa market. It&#039;s only when he shows it to his bemused sensei that he realizes that both the <em>wood</em> and carved<strong> design</strong> are <em>third-rate</em>!
