## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 5-3-2010(11): <a href="../2125">as is</a> (#2125 侭) variant. STORY: 儘 = まま. My <strong>mama</strong> was a <em>person</em> with many roles. I can picture her <em>raking</em> the embers on the <em>hearth floor</em> or putting down a <em>dish</em> of food for the dog.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 7-11-2009(7): <strong>As it is</strong>, Mr. T rakes in all the ones, with just an oven fire and a dish. The best chef in town <strong>as it is</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/haengbok92">haengbok92</a>] 6-10-2010(2): ままに： As it is: Best to leave things as they is foo, says Mr. T. So he does not rake the hearth fire nor clean his plates. He just leaves the kitchen &quot;as it is&quot;. (このままに）.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb">Mesqueeb</a>] 6-11-2009(2): Thecite は最初の儘で Mesqueeb <a href="midori://search?text=は弐番目で御座います。">は弐番目で御座います。</a> ^^.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FooSoft">FooSoft</a>] 16-4-2010(1): Mr. T <strong>as is</strong> is actually a white guy, but then if he goes around saying stuff like &quot;Foo&quot; he just sounds silly. So he rakes coals off the <em>hearth floor</em> of the fireplace, and puts them on the <em>dish</em> and eats them to become a black dude.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 3-11-2009(1): <a href="midori://search?text=俺は最初だ！">俺は最初だ！</a> .

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dannyboy4885">dannyboy4885</a>] 22-10-2012(): Keyword: <strong>as it stands</strong> (to differentiate from its variant <a href="../2125">as is</a> (#2125 侭)). Story: <em>Mr T</em> has lost his <em>oven</em> gloves. <strong>As it stands</strong> he&#039;s going to have use his garden <em>rake</em> to <em>rake</em> the <em>dish</em> out of the <em>oven</em> and onto the <em>floor</em> without burning his hands. &quot;I pity da foo who ain&#039;t got <em>oven</em> gloves!&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kerecsen">kerecsen</a>] 17-3-2011(): Mr T made pancakes, but he couldn&#039;t leave it <strong>as it is</strong>, and decided to try to turn it into a flambé. The fire on the plate got out of control, so he put a lid on it, and weighed it down with a rake (the only heavy metal object he could find on short notice).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 15-12-2010(): <strong>as it is</strong>: <strong>As it is</strong>, <em>Mr. T</em> is <em>raking</em> the <em>floor</em> with <em>flames</em> to prepare his <em>dish</em>. Don&#039;t know what&#039;s he&#039;s making, but my mama isn&#039;t going to like this.
