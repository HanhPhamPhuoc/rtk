2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 14-9-2010(14): Think of a chat in which <em>everyone</em> is writing <em>words</em> at once, of the lack of<strong> orderliness</strong> of such a chat. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chameleoncoder">chameleoncoder</a>] 19-8-2010(11): To have<strong> orderliness</strong>, your <em>words</em> must be in <em>all</em> the right places.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sekiei">sekiei</a>] 16-1-2013(1): A conversation of the utmost<strong> orderliness</strong>. <em>All words</em> are first written down and carefully considered before being <em>said</em> in order, so <em>all</em> can understand and think of an <strong>orderly</strong> response.

(A story so you don&#039;t confuse &quot;ALL&quot; with &quot;every&quot; or &quot;each&quot;...).
