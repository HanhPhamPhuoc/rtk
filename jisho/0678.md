heisig: "Let me share a rather grotesque image to help with this kanji. Imagine taking your <i>two hands</i> and reaching up into someone's <i>nostrils</i>. Once inside you grab hold of the <i>brain</i> and yank it out. At the end, you would have a picture something like that of this character, the full kanji for <b>nose</b>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-12-2007(220): An Egyptian embalmer reaching <em>both hands</em> into the dead pharaoh&#039;s <strong>nose</strong> and yanking out handfuls of <em>brain</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imojyochu">imojyochu</a>] 14-8-2008(104): I sneezed so hard that through my<strong> NOSE</strong> I blew out my BRAINS into BOTH HANDS. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 6-6-2006(36): Remember when you had the flu, and you were sneezing all the time? I bet you thought that you could end up holding your <em>brain</em> in <em>both hands</em> after it was spitted from your running <em>nose</em>! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 2-5-2006(15): An addition to Heisig&#039;s story in order to remember the position of the elements: Everyone hates people that turn their<strong> nose</strong>s &#039;up&#039; at people. This provides motivation to reach in through that turned up<strong> nose</strong> and drag out those brains with both hands. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ludd1t3_sp4nn3r">ludd1t3_sp4nn3r</a>] 8-5-2008(13): <em>Oneself</em> may experience hay fever from <em>rice fields</em> requiring <em>two hands</em> to cover the<strong> nose</strong> while sneezing. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gpetroce">gpetroce</a>] 10-8-2007(12): Remember the movie Total Recall? 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 3-8-2008(7): Through my<strong> NOSE</strong>, I pull out my BRAINS with TWO HANDS. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 23-9-2011(5): Heisig...Just goes ape-shit with the story. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 14-11-2007(5): Claritin commercial: person in a <em>field</em>, covering their sneeze with <em>two hands</em>. Ahhchoo! 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tsenita">tsenita</a>] 4-8-2009(4): Imagine a fatality for <em>Dhalsim</em> if he were in Mortal Kombat instead of Street Fighter - his <em>two hands</em> punch into his opponent&#039;s <em>nose</em> and pulls out their <em>brains</em>. The placement of the primitives shows the aftermath - the <em>nose</em> above, the <em>brains</em> held in <em>Dhalsim&#039;s two hands</em> underneath.
