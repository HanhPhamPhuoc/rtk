## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 7-8-2007(174): <strong>happiness</strong> is the ONE bite of SPICY curry.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 24-12-2006(89): This is one of those rare occasions when I forgo Heisig for other methods. <a href="midori://search?text=「幸せから一本取ると辛い」">「幸せから一本取ると辛い」</a> -- if you take but one stroke away from<strong> happiness</strong>, you get painfulness. (oh well, Heisig used similar one for 百 ).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-3-2007(44): <strong>Happiness</strong> and pain(spicy) are just one stroke diffence. It&#039;s a fine balance.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimitha">jimitha</a>] 10-10-2009(20): A rare instance in which Heisig made a mistake in the primitives. The bottom is not <em>spicy</em>, because there is no <em>vase</em> or <em>standing</em> here--the first horizontal stroke of the &quot;vase&quot; is too long. Rather, this is <em>soil</em> and a new primitive below, which we shall call a garden-variety <em>goat</em>. It&#039;s like the <em>mountain goat</em> in frame 1959, just not in the mountains. Thus,<strong> happiness</strong> is exemplified by a <em>goat</em> nibbling on <em>soil</em>ed garbage on the <em>ground</em>. (We&#039;ll only get to use <em>goat</em> once more, in frame 1613).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CaLeDee">CaLeDee</a>] 18-9-2008(14): <strong>Happiness</strong> adds a bit of spice to your life.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yuta73">Yuta73</a>] 25-4-2012(11): Heisig&#039;s got the primitives wrong. Here&#039;s my story: I can see, below the <em>ground</em>, through a basement window, <em>ten horny</em> girls. Now if I only can get there, <strong>happiness</strong> is assured. <strong>Lucky</strong> me that I saw them!.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skribblets">skribblets</a>] 1-9-2010(10): I&#039;m standing between two 10&#039;s! (supermodels) I&#039;m so happy!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 3-7-2007(8): <em>Spiciness</em> can be either good or bad. If you get the balance just right (adding the stroke at the top to make it more symmetric), then you can achieve<strong> happiness</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 27-1-2010(6): When eating SPICY food there&#039;s a fine LINE (the extra line at the top) between<strong> happiness</strong> and pain.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 20-9-2009(6): Spicy plus one =<strong> happiness</strong>... ... TIP you can turn it upside down and it&#039;s still pretty happy ;-).
