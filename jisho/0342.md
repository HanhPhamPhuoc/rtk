heisig: "Here we see a <i>samurai</i> standing on a street with an open <i>mouth</i>, which people walk up to and look down deep inside of for <b>good luck</b>. As a primitive, we shall take this shape to mean an aerosol can, from the mouth and the very tightly-fitting lid (note how it differs here from the lidded crock)."
