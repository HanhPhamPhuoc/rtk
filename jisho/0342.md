## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 9-2-2006(207): The mnemonic &quot;words to seduce the masses&quot; was just too vague and I kept forgetting it. So now instead I picture a seductive female reading aloud the<strong> imperial edict</strong> to the masses, thus &quot;seducing&quot; the masses. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 12-8-2008(56): The emperor did not need an <strong>imperial edict</strong>; his <em>words</em> were more than enough to <em>seduce</em> Anakin to the dark side. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RachelleUdell">RachelleUdell</a>] 17-7-2008(31): The <em>WORDS</em> of an<strong> IMPERIAL EDICT</strong> are meant to <em>SEDUCE</em> the people and make them obey. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 24-1-2008(19): Palpatine&#039;s<strong> imperial edict</strong> is a propaganda <em>speech</em> to attempt to <em>seduce</em> the masses to the Dark Side. (If you need extra help to remember the <em>seduce</em> part, think about some sexy photos of Darth Vader being included in it as well. The resulting image should be seared into your mind forever.). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 30-11-2009(13): The Patriot Act is the modern day version of an<strong> imperial edict</strong>. It uses a lot of fancy <em>words</em> to <em>seduce</em> people into giving up their freedoms. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 1-7-2008(7): Emperor Palpatine wants to <strong>seduce</strong> a beautiful geisha, so he is now learning Japanese. Observe Emperor Palpatine looking for the most <strong>seductive</strong> <strong>words</strong> to <strong>seduce</strong> the geisha at the<strong> IMPERIAL EDICT</strong> dictionary (like Jim Breen&#039;s EDICT dictionary). Yes, I know it has nothing to do with an<strong> IMPERIAL EDICT</strong> literally, but just try to imagine the picture and tell me if you can forget the kanji. XD. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 29-12-2010(5): The emperor does not need to use fancy <em>words</em> to <em>seduce</em> anyone he wants...he just has to issue an<strong> imperial edict</strong>.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/詔命">詔命</a>   しょうめい imperial command;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/詔書">詔書</a>   しょうしょ<strong> imperial edict</strong>; decree. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DJElo">DJElo</a>] 7-5-2012(4): An<strong> imperial edict</strong> uses words to seduce the people. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackswitch">jackswitch</a>] 31-10-2008(4): The<strong> IMPERIAL EDICT</strong> SAYS that the WORD &quot;SEDUCE&quot; shall no longer be SAID. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kirkaking">kirkaking</a>] 1-2-2012(3): An<strong> imperial edict</strong> is nothing more than a <em>speech</em> to <em>seduce</em> the masses.
