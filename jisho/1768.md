## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 3-4-2007(203): It&#039;s a tremendous match between the two chess-players. They are clearly eachother&#039;s equal. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 4-8-2007(49): These two <em>bushel baskets</em> are <strong>tremendously</strong> huge. But not only they are huge, they are also perfectly <em>equal</em> in size. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-3-2007(44): Losing both your <em>rooks</em> is <strong>tremendous</strong>. It&#039;s almost <em>equal</em> to having your queen&#039;s <em>legs</em> chopped from under her. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/baylin">baylin</a>] 8-7-2009(22): This kanji is<strong> tremendously</strong> difficult to remember because it is not <em>equal</em> to the other bushel baskets in this lesson. Their <em>bushel baskets</em> all have animal legs. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 15-6-2008(14): Equal I remember as the counter for small animals. Remember Battle Chess? I just picture a tremendous <strong>rook</strong> from Battle Chess wandering around stomping on <strong>little animals</strong>. Those guys were sweet. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 2-3-2011(12): There are four symbols for &#039;equal&#039; in this kanji. A big = , a small =, one standing up II , and the kanji   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/匹">匹</a>  . That&#039;s<strong> tremendously</strong> awesome! Don&#039;t you think!! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>] 14-3-2010(8): It&#039;s<strong> tremendously</strong> hard to find 2 Pokute (2  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/匹">匹</a>  ）who are exactly equal in appearance.　(primitive explanation <a href="http://img71.imageshack.us/img71/6628/pokute3vp.gif">http://img71.imageshack.us/img71/6628/pokute3vp.gif</a> ) . This becomes new primitive meaning 2 pokute. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 6-5-2008(8): Gary Kasparov is not<strong> tremendously</strong> popular with the opposite sex. Lesson: Chess stardom does not equal a tremendous love life. (Primitive image: Kasparov hugging a<strong> tremendously</strong> big stuffed rook). Hint: I use rook for bushel basket, and Gasparov for when the bushel basket is on the top. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 14-4-2009(5): Beneath the chess players, a small animal was running about tickling their toes. It was<strong> tremendously</strong> annoying. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 28-11-2008(4): Bushel Bucket + Equal: We are<strong> tremendously</strong> lucky to live a country where <em>bushel buckets</em> are full and everyone is <em>equal</em>.
