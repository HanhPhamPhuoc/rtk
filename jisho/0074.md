## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rinifett">Rinifett</a>] 25-9-2007(200): Keep an eye on your<strong> tool</strong>s while you work at the table.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 27-8-2007(107): One<strong> tool</strong> nobody should be without - a Mordor-type eye that floats over the workbench. It jerks around, monitoring all who come near, and if anyone so much as removes a stapler from the bench - ZAP.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alimasag">alimasag</a>] 28-10-2007(83): You need a strong<strong> tool</strong> to remove the legs from a shellfish.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonmayes">jonmayes</a>] 11-7-2008(26): You need a strong a<strong> tool</strong> to separate the legs from a shellfish.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wreckz">wreckz</a>] 23-1-2008(19): Like my shop teacher always said... In order to use any<strong> tool</strong> at your <em>workbench</em> you must first make sure to wear your safety goggles to protect your <em>eyes</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cloudstrife543">cloudstrife543</a>] 31-10-2008(13): The best<strong> tool</strong> is your eye.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jared">Jared</a>] 22-1-2008(11): Yeah, I caught her eyeing my<strong> tool</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 23-8-2007(9): One cut the Legs off of a Shellfish with a<strong> TOOL</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 17-12-2009(8): For me this is a pictograph. What are the two most basic<strong> tool</strong>s every craftsman needs? A level (eye) and a<strong> tool</strong> bench.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 21-7-2009(4): Yes, you can use the<strong> tool</strong>, but I&#039;m going to keep an <em>eye</em> on you. It&#039;s over there on the <em>stool</em>.
