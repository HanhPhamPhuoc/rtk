## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 16-3-2007(157): Continued from <a href="../v4/1088">auspicious</a> (#1088 祥). Once a year, the people pray for a sign from the gods. But if the gods are feeling particularly mischievous, they&#039;ll send down a <em>jawbone</em> to the <em>altar</em>. The people see this as a sign of<strong> calamity</strong> to come. The gods think of it as an amusing prank.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rivvie">Rivvie</a>] 4-6-2008(71): Truely a<strong> calamity</strong> for an undead wedding, just as he may kiss the bride at the <em>altar</em>, he loses his <em>jawbone</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rooboy">Rooboy</a>] 30-3-2009(42): Bit of a<strong> calamity</strong> at the wedding. The bride tripped and broke her <em>jawbone</em> on the <em>altar</em>. Funniest home vids here we come.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 6-12-2007(19): Well, for Jawbone I think of Samson and his JAWBONE of an ass. So, Samson caused great<strong> CALAMITY</strong> at the Philistine ALTAR when he attack the priesthood with that JAWBONE of an ass.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gopineapples">gopineapples</a>] 1-7-2009(10): The pope fell at the ALTAR and smashed his JAWBONE. Wine and blood everywhere. What a<strong> calamity</strong>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 18-3-2008(8): (I changed &quot;Jawbone&quot; to &quot;Jaws&quot; from the James Bond films - powerful joint of the mouth covered in a cowl) It&#039;s a<strong> calamity</strong> when Jaws shows up and bites your altar - surely the gods will be angry with you for not protecting it.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 14-5-2007(8): I see the <em>jawbone</em> primative as a <em>skull</em> which has the jawbone joint as part of the hood (skull) that contains the mouth. Then use gorgon&#039;s story - Indiana Jones starts his &#039;Raiders of the Lost Arc&#039; adventure in the forests of South America raiding an <em>altar</em> that has a <em>skull</em> (idol really, but a skull for this story!) that he wants. Then just when he&#039;s escaped the rolling rock<strong> calamity</strong> strikes: the Belgian baddie turns up, steals the skull then sets Hovito indians after Indy.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/childofthetao">childofthetao</a>] 26-7-2010(7): A<strong> calamity</strong> at the <em>altar</em>, during the wedding, <em>Jaws</em> turns up and eats everyone.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 27-10-2006(5): (re: wrightak)<strong> Calamity</strong> Jane at the altar wedding &quot;<em>Jawbone</em>&quot; Jay Leno. What a<strong> calamity</strong>!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/awaken">awaken</a>] 19-8-2012(4): <strong>Calamity</strong> Jane went to the <em>altar</em> to confess her sins and the priest&#039;s <em>jawbone</em> fell to the floor.
