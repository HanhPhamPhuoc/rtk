## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 17-10-2007(193): <em>Bamboo craft</em>ing is a <em>mediocre</em> substitute for <em>wood</em> when you are <strong>build</strong>ing or <strong>fabricat</strong>ing a house. While it may look good and might attract a chick (ちく) or two, the kids&#039;ll (きず) just tear it to pieces as its not sturdy enough.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 25-7-2007(112): A bamboo fabrication is a mediocre substitute for wood.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 20-11-2007(81): If you<strong> fabricate</strong> a boat from <em>bamboo</em> you get a pretty <em>mediocre craft</em>. Use <em>wood</em> instead.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peacemik">peacemik</a>] 21-10-2008(51): Just as you wouldn&#039;t want heart surgeons who were <em>mediocre</em> at their <em>craft</em> operating on you (see raulir&#039;s story for <a href="../613">fear</a> (#613 恐)), you also wouldn&#039;t want house builders who were <em>mediocre</em> at their <em>craft</em> <strong>fabricating</strong> your house for you--they might<strong> fabricate</strong> a flimsy one of <em>bamboo</em> instead of sturdy one of <em>wood</em>. 建築 (けんちく): construction, architecture 建築家 (けんちくか): architect 築き上げる (きずきあげる): to build up/establish (one&#039;s reputation) Careful: <a href="../869">erect</a> (#869 架).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(26): Note: <em>bamboo + craft + mediocre</em> are later combined into 筑 <a href="../2637">ancient harp</a> (#2637 筑).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kambei">Kambei</a>] 3-6-2009(18): (THX Katsuo. SEE <a href="../2637">ancient harp</a> (#2637 筑)) <em>Ancient harps</em> ( 筑 ) were made of <em>bamboo</em>. To<strong> fabricate</strong> modern harps, the instrument makers need a <em>craft</em> that the <em>mediocre</em> ones don&#039;t have. Nowadays the harps are made of <em>wood</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nekoyaki">nekoyaki</a>] 27-4-2009(18): (primitives in order) If you<strong> fabricate</strong> it using <em>bamboo</em>, your <em>craft</em> will be <em>mediocre</em>. You should use <em>wood</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(6): <strong>Fabricate</strong> has sort of a falsehood connotation to me. So - you use <em>bamboo</em> to<strong> fabricate</strong> a <em>tree</em> (to fool the silly Japanese after having stolen their <em>trees</em> with your brilliant <a href="../948">scheme</a> (#948 策)). You <em>craft</em> it with <em>bamboo</em>, and you realize that it is really looking pretty <em>mediocre</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 12-4-2010(5): You can only<strong> FABRICATE</strong> MEDIOCRE I-BEAMS from BAMBOO or WOOD - look how easy they bend...

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akahige">akahige</a>] 22-2-2009(5): In Hong Kong, when workers <strong>build</strong> a <strong>build</strong>ing, they start with a <em>bamboo</em> scaffolding, taking great care with the <em>craftsmanship</em>. No <em>mediocre wood</em> is to be used in this scaffolding and this <strong>fabrication</strong>, by god!
