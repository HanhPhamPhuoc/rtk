heisig: "When we speak of <b>burying</b> something (or someone, for that matter), we usually mean putting them under <i>ground</i>. Only here, we are <b>burying</b> our beloved <i>computer</i> that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the &quot;Dies irae, dies illa&quot; and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little <i>dirt</i> into what will be its final resting place. R.I.P."
