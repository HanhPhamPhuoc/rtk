heisig: The word <b>nitrate</b> should immediately suggest a beaker of <b>nitric</b> acid, which, as every high-school chemistry student knows, can eat its way through some pretty tough substances. Here we imagine pouring it over a <i>rock</i> and watching the <i>sparks</i> fly as it bores a hole through the rock.
