heisig: We have already learned the kanji for <i>sand</i> (Frame 122), so let's use it to remember the character for <b>grains of sand</b>. Instead of the "few stones" that make for nice sand, here we have a <i>few drops of water</i>, one for each <b>grand of sand</b> - a beach in perfect ecological balance.
