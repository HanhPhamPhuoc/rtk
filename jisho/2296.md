heisig: "We have already learned the kanji for <i>sand</i> (Frame 122), so let's use it to remember the character for <b>grains of sand</b>. Instead of the &quot;few stones&quot; that make for nice sand, here we have a <i>few drops of water</i>, one for each <b>grand of sand</b> - a beach in perfect ecological balance."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 15-7-2009(58): To keep this separated from <a href="../117">sand</a> <span class="index">(#117 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/砂">砂</a>)</span>: <em>Water</em> erodes away stone a <em>few</em><strong> grains of sand</strong> at a time until there is no stone left. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 15-2-2007(31): Wet sand is simply sand but to see beautiful<strong> grains of sand</strong>, the <em>water</em> must be <em>few</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-5-2009(18): Each <em>water</em> wave washes away a <em>few</em><strong> grains of sand</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 8-10-2010(5): This kanji is used in a lot of girl’s names.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/理沙">理沙</a>  (りさ)  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/、沙織">、沙織</a>  (さおり)  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/、沙百合">、沙百合</a>  (さゆり). Maybe guys can think of this kind of like the classic advice there a lots of fish in <em>water</em>(ocean), lots of girls out there for you. You might think that it&#039;s hopeless and there are only <em>a few</em> girls out there, but girls are like<strong> grains of sand</strong>. Keep looking for the right one! 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 15-4-2008(5): Where there are many<strong> grains of sand</strong> there are <em>few</em> drops of <em>water</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 7-4-2008(5): There needs to be <em>few</em> stones to make high-quality <a href="../117">sand</a> <span class="index">(#117 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/砂">砂</a>)</span>, to be sure ... but what you need even <em>fewer</em> of to make the finest <strong>grains of sand</strong> is drops of <em>water</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(5): <strong>Grains of sand</strong> can only hold a <em>few</em> drops of <em>water</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 25-8-2009(3): You&#039;ll get a <em>few</em><strong> grains of sand</strong> in a mouthful of ocean <em>water</em>. The chance of it actually doing any harm is like 1 out of a 100,000,000. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 27-10-2006(2): When NASA went to Mars the first time with a probe, they did tests to see whether there was <em>water</em> present, but they couldn&#039;t even find a <em>few</em> drops of it in the<strong> grains of sand</strong> they tested. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 10-1-2013(1): I renamed this to <strong>grit</strong> to avoid confusion with <a href="../117">sand</a> <span class="index">(#117 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/砂">砂</a>)</span>. Think of the stuff that is put on roads and pavements when the weather is cold to prevent them freezing over. It only takes a <em>few drops</em> to make a difference.
