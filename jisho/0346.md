heisig: Since silence is treasured so highly at a <i>Buddhist temple</i> the <i>words</i> spoken there must be well-chosen. Perhaps this is why the records of the monks often read to us like <b>poems</b>. Before going on, back up a frame and make sure you have kept <b>poem</b> and <i>recitation</i> distinct in your mind.
