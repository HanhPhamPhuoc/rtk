heisig: "What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning &quot;everywhere&quot; or &quot;heaps of&quot; was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see <i>two suns</i>, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the <i>three suns</i> of <i>sparkle</i>. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of <b>prosperous</b> times as <i>sunny</i>, what could be more <b>prosperous</b> than a sky with <i>two suns</i> in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 25-9-2006(469): If you work from Sun UP to Sun DOWN you will be<strong> prosperous</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cutiehuni">cutiehuni</a>] 14-2-2009(76): I kept getting this mixed up with meanings like &#039;fortune&#039;, so here is a fool proof story! Remember the Vulcan salute from &#039;Star Trek&#039; (a fiction of the sci-fi genre in which heavenly bodies such as SUNS play a huge role) used with the phrase &#039;live long and PROSPER&#039;? If that&#039;s not enough of a visual reminder, the Vulcan salute shows the fingers parted in to 2 sets of 2, and visually kind of looks like this kanji if you think about it.
