heisig: "First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the <i>drop</i> at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left. This happens because a single, isolated drop will NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would drop off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the tiny <i>drop</i> indicate a further belittling of what is already <i>little</i>&nbsp;- thus making it a <b>few</b> of something <i>little</i>."
