heisig: "The final stage of the seed is reached when the plant has reached its full growth (the <i>tree</i>) and comes to fruition, producing <b>fruit</b> full of new seeds that can return to the earth and start the process all over again. The main thing to notice here is the element for <i>brains</i> at the top, which might prove more helpful than <i>rice field</i> for creating an image. The writing, however, follows the order of a <i>sun</i> with a <i>tree</i> whose trunk runs through the <i>sun</i>."

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 17-1-2009(9): <strong>Fruit</strong> is like a productive <em>rice field</em> that grows on top of a <em>tree</em>.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/悪因悪果">悪因悪果</a>   (sewing &amp; reaping evil).   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/悪果">悪果</a>  (bad results).   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/無花果果">無花果果</a>  (fig).   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/因果">因果</a>   (cause &amp; effect).   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/規模効果">規模効果</a>  (economies of scale). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 20-8-2006(9): Instead of <em>brains</em> use <em>rice field</em> and we see a bunch of <em>fruit</em> trees growing about the perimeter of a <em>rice field</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 22-5-2006(9): So <em>that&#039;s</em> why<strong> fruit</strong>s are so squishy and juicy... Tree&#039;s brains! The scales fell from my eyes. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mavelle">mavelle</a>] 16-5-2011(7): Note the stroke order!! Better to use <em>sun and tree</em>..... Imagine:<strong> Fruit</strong>(plants) that can grow as TALL as a TREE even blocking the SUN. (you see? first draw the sun and than the tall tree). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 21-2-2008(5): Learn <a href="../807">incur</a> <span class="index">(#807 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/被">被</a>)</span> <a href="../1121">fruit</a> <span class="index">(#1121 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/果">果</a>)</span> <a href="../1124">naked</a> <span class="index">(#1124 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/裸">裸</a>)</span> together 1st part of the story ( carried on with naked and concluded with incur) If only Eve had used her brains and not taken the forbidden<strong> fruit</strong> from the tree.... then she wouldn&#039;t have been aware that she was naked (2nd part of the story). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 26-12-2007(5): <strong>stroke order</strong>: first draw a <em>sun</em> and then a <em>tree</em> with the vertical stroke starting inside the <em>sun</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 22-2-2013(3): All<strong> fruit</strong> needs plenty of <em>sun</em> for it to ripen <strong>on</strong> the <em>tree</em>. When you finish writing this (the <strong>sixth</strong> stroke completes <em>brain</em> and doubles as the <strong>second</strong> of <em>tree</em>) you will see you have created the <em>brain tree</em>. For a picture of the<strong> fruit</strong> of the <em>brain tree</em> follow the link provided by mspertus below. (thanks all).
