heisig: "Above we have the condensed form of <i>bound up</i>, and below the familiar <i>shellfish</i>. Now imagine two <i>oysters</i> engaged in <i>shell</i>-to-<i>shell</i> combat, the one who is <b>defeated</b> being <i>bound and gagged</i> with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The <i>bound shellfish</i> thus becomes the symbol for <b>defeat</b>."
