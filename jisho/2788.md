## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(38): The <em>team of horses</em> is nervously asking a <em>tiger</em> not to eat them. &quot;Don&#039;t worry&quot;, says the <em>tiger</em>, &quot;over in that <em>paddyfield</em> I can see my favourite <em>dish</em> –<strong> donkey</strong>!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 14-2-2009(8): The team of <em>horses</em> ran when they saw the <em>tiger</em>. But the stubborn<strong> donkey</strong> continued drinking from his <em>dish</em> in the open <em>field</em>. Talk about easy prey.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 11-3-2010(4): It could so easily have been a &quot;Trojan <strong>donkey</strong>&quot; or even a &quot;Trojan <em>tiger</em>&quot; but for a <em>brain</em> storming session in which suggestions were thrown into a <em>dish</em>. The &quot;<em>Trojan horse</em>&quot; idea came out first.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 11-4-2010(3): <strong>Donkeys</strong> are small <em>horses</em> that can therefore fit into <em>huts</em> <a href="../30439">Unicode-0x76e7</a> (#30439 盧).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EusthEnoptEron">EusthEnoptEron</a>] 20-12-2008(1): When the greeks were waiting inside the <em>trojan horse</em>, they heard that the trojans eat <em>tiger</em> <em>brains</em> as their main <em>dish</em> every day. Suddenly, they felt like they were in a mere<strong> donkey</strong>, rather than in a sovereign horse.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shidosuru">shidosuru</a>] 5-2-2012(): Ok I got the best one. So a tiger and a horse were having sex in a rice field and instantly a fetus splatted out of the tiger onto a plate - it&#039;s a<strong> donkey</strong>!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 7-3-2011(): A<strong> Donkey</strong> can work just as well as a <em>team of horses</em> on the <em>field</em> , but they have some disadvantages too. They are asses for one. And they have some blinkers to learning. For example, they never learn that they will end up on the <em>dish</em> if they go near a <em>tiger</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 17-2-2011(): A dumbass<strong> donkey</strong> in a <em>Trojan horse</em> attacked a <em>tiger</em> who liked <em>brain</em> of ass as his favorite <em>dish</em>. This is how the &quot;Bikuri<strong> Donkey</strong>&quot; restaurant in Japan got its name.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Uncreativity">Uncreativity</a>] 8-8-2010(): When a <em>horse</em> tries to mate with a <em>tiger</em> in a <em>rice field</em>, the poor thing ends up on a <em>plate</em>. It&#039;s NOT how you breed<strong> donkey</strong>s.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(): The <em>magical house of seven tigers</em> usually feeds the tigers <em>horse</em> <em>brains</em> on a <em>dish</em>, but when meat is scarce they use those of a<strong> donkey</strong>, and the tigers don&#039;t know the difference.
