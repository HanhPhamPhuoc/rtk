heisig: "This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrase sand sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase <b>but of course</b>. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a <i>teenager</i>, and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. "Did you have a good shower?" "<b>But of course</b>," you reply, annoyed. So <i>water</i> and <i>teenager</i> combine to give us <b>but of course</b>."
