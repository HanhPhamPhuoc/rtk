heisig: "This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrase sand sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase <b>but of course</b>. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a <i>teenager</i>, and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. &quot;Did you have a good shower?&quot; &quot;<b>But of course</b>,&quot; you reply, annoyed. So <i>water</i> and <i>teenager</i> combine to give us <b>but of course</b>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 21-9-2006(174): If you ask your <em>teenager</em> if what he&#039;s drinking is <em>water</em> (and not Vodka), he will answer &quot;but of course&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 10-4-2008(137): キョウ<strong> But of course</strong>, this character really means &quot;situation/condition&quot;. &quot;Elder brother gulped some water and said, &#039;What the hell was Heisig&#039;s mental CONDITION when he came up with this definition? Heisig must have a drinking CONDITION.<strong> But of course</strong>, if Heisig sticks to water, rather than sake (like me, <em>water</em> quaffing, situation assessing, sober <em>elder brother</em>), his SITUATION may improve.&#039;&quot;　[MODEL COMPOUND: 状況 (じょうきょう)　state of affairs; conditions].

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 15-9-2008(61): A wet teenager is good ,<strong> but of course</strong> it is illegal.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 12-2-2008(52): Would you like to throw <em>water</em> on your <em>elder brother</em>? <strong>But of course</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 11-12-2006(35): This kanji is actually used the normally in the words &quot; 況して &quot; and &quot; 況や &quot;, which mean &quot;Even more so...&quot; or &quot;Even less so...&quot; depending on the context. So, everyone should use <em>water</em> to clean themselves, <em>even more so</em> <em>teenagers</em> prone to body odors.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 26-8-2008(16): In this [situation], would you throw <em>water</em> on your <em>elder brother</em> even in his [condition]?<strong> BUT OF COURSE</strong>! Bwaaahahaha.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 18-7-2008(15): When you stuck your drops in the hole (mouth) between her (human) legs you used a condom right?<strong> But of course</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hikarudo">hikarudo</a>] 20-8-2008(9): The keyword for this kanji really should be situation or condition. If the situation of your <em>elder brother&#039;s</em> alcoholism isn&#039;t getting any better, try giving him some fresh <em>water</em>. It works miracles!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 30-7-2007(7): <strong>But of course</strong> your ELDER BROTHER needs WATER to survive!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saleem">saleem</a>] 19-3-2008(6): If you&#039;ve seen the old Grey Poupon commercials, (&#039;Have you any Gray Poupon?&#039;, &#039;BUT OF COURSE.&#039;)... then it&#039;s easy. Just think of a grumpy TEENAGER throwing WATER in the face of stodgy questioner.
