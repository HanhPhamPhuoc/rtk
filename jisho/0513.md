heisig: Above, an <i>eye</i> and a <i>fishhook</i>,&nbsp;and below the primitive for <i>little</i>. Although apparently the simplest of these first six kanji, when you begin to work on its plot and story you will soon find out that the number of strokes and visual complexity of a kanji does not make it easier or harder to remember. It is the primitives you have to work that are the critical factor, as in this case where the meaning of the key word is so seemingly distant from the elements. Remember, you can always break larger elements down (<i>eye of a needle</i> into <i>eye</i> and <i>fishhook</i>) if you think it helps.
