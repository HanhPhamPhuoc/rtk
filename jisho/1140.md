3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 4-4-2008(26): The yellow flag at the exit indicates one should<strong> yield</strong> to oncoming traffic and pedestrians.

If you don&#039;t<strong> yield</strong>, a cop will pull you over, make you <em>exit</em> your car, and <em>pee</em> all over you. (Note: I use &quot;pee&quot; for the &quot;flag&quot; primitive).

Well let me tell you that it<strong> yield</strong>s a lot of points when Mario jumps high towards the <em>flag</em> at the <em>exit</em>. Just watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZt-w99WE_0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZt-w99WE_0</a> till sec 40.

You flinch and bend over by the EXIT trying to hold your PEE as you<strong> YIELD</strong> to the man EXITING the stall. Phew! That was close! (flinch, bend &amp; submit are other meanings of this kanji).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rucury">rucury</a>] 8-4-2012(4): Here we have Mr. Resetti from the Animal Crossing series! After I turn off the power without saving for the 1,000,000th time, Mr. Resetti appears and says: &quot;Forget you! I<strong> yield</strong>!&quot;. He shows a white <em>flag</em> and proceeds to <em>exit</em> the game forever... Mr. Resetti will come in handy in the next frame, <a href="../1061">dig</a> (#1061 掘).

A car is <em>exiting</em> a car garage in the city, and a guy holding a <em>flag</em> is standing on the left out front to have him<strong> yield</strong> for traffic.
