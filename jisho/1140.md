8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa">Piitaa</a>] 18-6-2006(14): In Ancient Japan, calendars were fashioned out of wood, each day on its own board. Obviously, the day that has been sawn off is<strong> yesterday</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiaoma">xiaoma</a>] 21-2-2009(5): My coworker has an excessive way of updating his daily calendar. Instead of just crossing off<strong> yesterday</strong>&#039;s box, he prefers to actually <em>saw</em> it off! (inspired by akrodha).
