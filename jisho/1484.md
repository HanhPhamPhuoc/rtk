## Heisig story:

This character is easiest remembered as a pictograph of a water lily floating on the surface of the water, which gives it its meaning of <b>even</b>. The fourth stroke represents the calm, smooth surface of a pond, and the final stroke the long stem of the plant reaching underwater.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 15-10-2006(106): There&#039;s an<strong> even</strong> covering of <em>water lilies</em> on the pond at 金閣寺 （きんかくじ） the Golden Pavilion in Kyoto.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 7-9-2008(50): <strong>Even</strong> if Heisig showed me in person, I still wouldn&#039;t believe that this is a <em>water lily</em>. I don&#039;t get it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 9-4-2008(28): The graph of an<strong> even</strong> function [f(x)] will be symmetrical over the y-axis, as this kanji appears to be.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 28-2-2008(23): If you take scissors and cut off the upper part of its primitive and then close your scissors, you get an<strong> even</strong> kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 22-7-2009(19): This is<strong> even</strong> as in flat, level, smooth, calm (not like &quot;even if&quot; or &quot;even though&quot;).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-9-2008(13): <em>Drops</em> of water laying<strong> even</strong>ly on a <em>water lily</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 1-9-2011(11): 平家物語 , 平民 , <a href="../1484">even</a> (#1484 平) ヘイ, ヒョウ, ひら ... Similar Keywords: 均す <a href="../160">level</a> (#160 均), 平家 <a href="../1484">even</a> (#1484 平) ... Confusing Kanji: 半 , 干 , 平 , 〒 ..1. 半 <a href="../1202">half</a> (#1202 半)has little cuts that are later expanded into quarters on top, because you cannot cut from the middle ..2. 干 <a href="../1648">dry</a> (#1648 干)Dry has all the drops dried from the<strong> Even</strong> lily pad. ..3. 平 <a href="../1484">even</a> (#1484 平)is smooth on top, balanced left to right and top to bottom, though you still need a point on the bottom to check balance. ..4. 〒 Postal Symbol.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(7): Woohoo, <strong>even</strong> I can see the <em>water lily</em> here! The first three strokes represent the lily. As Heisig says, the fourth is the <strong>even</strong> waters of the pond, and the vertical stroke is it&#039;s stem, reaching down into the water.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 7-12-2009(5): HINT: This is<strong> even</strong> as in flat or level. It is not<strong> even</strong> as in &quot;even number&quot; which uses <a href="../1955">accidentally</a> (#1955 偶) - 偶数 <strong> even</strong> number.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shuusaku">shuusaku</a>] 2-2-2010(4): An<strong> EVEN</strong> <a href="../897">harmony</a> (#897 和) gives you PEACE 平和 , which is best appreciated if you look at the<strong> EVEN</strong> covering of <em>water lillies</em> on the pond of the temple.
