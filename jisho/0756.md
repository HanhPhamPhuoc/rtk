## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-3-2006(203): Think of the <em>flower-vessels</em> as a the Greenpeace vessel “Arctic Sunrise”, only instead of a rainbow there is a big <em>flower</em> painted on the hull (this will come back in <a href="../v4/701">seize</a> (#701 獲) and <a href="../v4/908">harvest</a> (#908 穫)). Think of “flower-power” and of the “peace” in “Greenpeace” and it will make some sense hopefully. -- In this kanji, we see an inauguration <em>speech</em> being given before the Greenpeace vessel is set afloat and sent to<strong> safeguard</strong> our planet.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 24-11-2007(128): <em>Words</em> and <em>Flowers</em> are exchanged between sailors and their wives before they board the <em>vessel</em> to<strong> safeguard</strong> the world.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samueruht">samueruht</a>] 20-1-2008(126): (With sarcasm) A Bush speech telling how all the US <em>vessels</em> are always welcomed, covered with <em>flowers</em> and <em>word</em>s of gratitude for<strong> safeguard</strong>ing democracy from the evil doers.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 14-4-2007(38): The <em>flower vessel</em> is of course the <em>Mayflower</em> in which the pilgrims came to America in their search for turkeys. During they trip, they prayed non-stop - using <em>words</em> as spells to<strong> safeguard</strong> Mayflower from danger.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 3-11-2008(22): Thanks to fuaburisu with modification Think of the <em>flower-vessels</em> as a ship full of hippies garlanded with flowers -- In this kanji, we see that the hippies carry no weapons on the ship to<strong> safeguard</strong> against pirates. No, because of their nonviolence pact they have decided they will fend off pirates only with their words.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 26-3-2008(13): The pass<em>word</em> to<strong> safeguard</strong> the <em>vessel</em> is &quot;May<em>flower</em>.&quot; You cannot get onto the vessel without it.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 23-12-2007(13): If you used &quot;Donald Duck&quot; to remember <a href="../v4/699">vessels</a> (#699 隻), you could use here &quot;Daisy Duck&quot; to remember the right part of this kanji. The three nephews of Donald have found a<strong> safeguard</strong> to escape from his wrath: they can threat him to <em>tell</em> <em>Daisy</em>!!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KeshaFran">KeshaFran</a>] 24-10-2010(7): In order to<strong> safeguard</strong> that a shipping vessel would make it back safely, people <em>SAY</em> bon voyage and put <em>FLOWERS</em> on the <em>VESSEL</em> as it leaves the port.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/foolalex">foolalex</a>] 6-5-2010(5): The flower vessel is full of hippies. Imagine the hippie boat using words instead of weapons to try to<strong> safeguard</strong> the planet. Yelling at whaling ships, &quot;You meanies. You should really stop&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 6-1-2010(5): The captain said in loud WORDs, &quot;SAFEGAURD the may-FLOWER VESSEL, it is our most precious possession!&quot;.
