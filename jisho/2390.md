## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thairob">thairob</a>] 6-8-2008(37): After eating all the<strong> BRACKEN</strong> FLOWERS on the CLIFF, the MOUNTAIN GOAT belts out a huge YAWN and takes a nap. Unfortunately he never wakes up as the<strong> BRACKEN</strong> is highly carcinogenic to mountain goats....

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(15): <strong>Bracken</strong> is a <em>flower</em> that grows on <em>cliffs</em> and resembles a <em>fish spine</em> <em>lacking</em> stability.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 3-7-2009(8): This is the name of a city (わらび) in Saitama. The kanji is so difficult to write, the city government sells a t-shirt with the stroke order: <a href="http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090702p2a00m0na004000c.html">http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090702p2a00m0na004000c.html</a>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-5-2007(7): These unusual type of<strong> bracken</strong> <em>plants</em> do not grow in the usual forest places, but actually high on a <em>cliff</em>. Because the area <em>lacks</em> <em>mountaingoats</em>, the plants aren&#039;t eaten by them.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 5-12-2009(2): <em>Lackin&#039;</em> the<strong> bracken</strong> to blacken: An old tale in the <em>mountain goat</em> community has it that a wee goat may attain the black coat so much admired in the dominant discourse by eating the small <em>flowers</em> of a particular variety of<strong> bracken</strong> that grows on a particular <em>cliff</em>. This Kanji depicts one who tried it, ate all the<strong> bracken</strong> he could hold, but, alas, he had the wrong cliff, &amp; therefore the wrong<strong> bracken</strong>. His coat has not changed &amp; he is in despair, still <em>lackin&#039;</em> the<strong> bracken</strong> to blacken.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 2-6-2011(1): The <em>mountain goat</em> climbed the <em>cliff</em> looking for<strong> bracken</strong> <em>flowers</em>. But he got to the top and found it was <em>lackin&#039;</em><strong> bracken</strong>, so he went home unsatisfied. (わらび, a tasty vegetable used in tempura and bibimbap, which unfortunately contains ptaquiloside, a toxin which causes poisoning and stomach cancer.) <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%93%E4%B8%AD%E6%AF%92">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%93%E4%B8%AD%E6%AF%92</a>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 15-11-2008(1): The <strong>Wallabies (わらび)</strong> hide in the flowers at the top of the cliff, it&#039;s the only place which <em>lacks mountain goats</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 18-6-2007(): The<strong> bracken</strong> are the most successful ferns, evolutionary: the <em>flowers</em> grow so high on the <em>cliff face</em> that even the mighty <em>mountain goat</em> cannot reach them, but rather must <em>yawn</em> at its own impotence. Also,<strong> bracken</strong>s are carcinogenic, hence the really high rates of stomach cancer in Japan and Korea.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dalmim">dalmim</a>] 14-11-2011(): The<strong> BRACKEN</strong> fern&#039;s lacy, <em>flower</em>-like fronds prefer <em>cliff</em>-sides. But, where they alone thrive, <em>mountain goat</em>s may be <em>lack</em>ing. The<strong> BRACKEN</strong> is poisonous to them in quantity.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 13-9-2011(): 蕨 , 蕨餅 , <a href="midori://search?text=埼玉県蕨市＊">埼玉県蕨市＊</a> , <a href="../2405">bracken</a> (#2405 蕨) ケツ, わらび ... Parts: 艹,厥( 厂, 屰, 欠 ) (cf 備 <a href="../1183">equip</a> (#1183 備)) ... Story: The <em>Yawning, Lisping, Mountain Goat</em> asks Mr.T for helping in getting <em>Equipped</em> to do a minstrel show. Mr.T gets angry and leaves, talking his <em>Screwdriver</em> with him. &quot;But Mr. T, all I want to do is<strong> Bracken</strong> my face!&quot; he brays.
