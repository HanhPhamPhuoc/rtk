heisig: "This character is a sort of nickname for the Japanese flag with its well-known emblem of the <b>rising sun</b>. If you can picture two seams running down that great red <i>sun</i>, and then imagine it sitting on a <i>baseball</i> bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent - but not altogether inaccurate - picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the <b>Rising Sun</b>."
