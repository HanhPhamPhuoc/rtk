Hint: recall the German legend of the English missionary, Saint Boniface, who <b>felled</b> the sacred oak tree dedicated to Thor at Geismar (in lower Hessia), occasioning a great <i>fiesta</i> for the Christians in the neighborhood to mark the defeat of their pagan competition. Be sure to fit your special <i>person</i> into the story if you use it."
