heisig: The <b>spinal column</b> has sprouted out of the <i>flesh</i> of your back into an <i>umbrella</i> that you always have with you, rain or shine. The pair of 2s on each side are the "ribs" of the <i>umbrella</i>. Take care to keep your image of the key word distinct from that for spine (Frame 24).
