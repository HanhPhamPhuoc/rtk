## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 1-10-2006(281): Most<strong> research</strong> scientists have 9 holes.....two nostrils, two ears, a mouth, and four eyes...... :-).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 13-3-2007(98): Scientiest are<strong> research</strong>ing , and have already found <em>nine</em> black <em>holes</em> !

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 15-1-2008(63): The manager is doing<strong> research</strong> to find the <em>holes</em> in the opposing <em>baseball team</em>&#039;s strategy.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/leecha2">leecha2</a>] 30-7-2009(36): When I saw this kanji I had the instant image of scientists throwing a <em>baseball</em> through a <em>hole</em> and noting the &#039;results&#039;. I found that quite hilarious, but well, maybe it&#039;s just me.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 30-11-2008(32): <strong>Research</strong> has shown that <em>9 holes</em> of golf can help alleviate stress.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gilch">gilch</a>] 7-8-2010(17): The planetarium originally had <em>nine</em> planets on display. However, after further<strong> research</strong>, science concluded that Pluto was never actually a planet to begin with. Of course, they removed it from the exhibit, leaving behind a gaping <em>hole</em>, and only <em>eight</em> planets left under the <em>roof</em>. (remember 8 is compacted to <em>human legs</em> when an element appears under <em>hole</em>).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wingedge">wingedge</a>] 22-12-2007(10): When you<strong> research</strong> something, you try to go the <em>&quot;hole-nine(yards)&quot;</em>, not just get a fact here or there to fit your point of view. (very slight add. to ruisu :) ).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 8-7-2009(6): Don&#039;t worry, these <em>nine holes</em> of golf are part of my<strong> research</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 26-7-2008(6): <strong>Research</strong> is one part inspiration - finding a <em>hole</em> in a theory - and <em>nine</em> parts perspiration - figuring out how to fix it!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lugelen">lugelen</a>] 23-5-2012(5): Hey, guess what? &quot;<strong>Research</strong>&quot; in Japanese is けんきゅう -- and this kanji is the &quot;kyuu&quot; in kenkyuu, so it already sounds like nine! So I imagine professor Ken<strong> research</strong>ing a <em>hole</em> for <em>nine</em> semesters to figure out where it came from. &quot;The<strong> research</strong> of <em>holes</em> took Ken <em>kyuu</em> semesters to finish.&quot;.
