## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 14-12-2007(221): <strong>Grace</strong> here is a favor freely bestowed, like a good deed. So to remember this kanji, go to the local shelter, find a <em>big dog pent up in a small cage</em> and adopt him. That will <em>cause</em> a warm feeling in your <em>heart</em>! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(111): This kanji tells us that wherever heart is the cause,<strong> grace</strong> is the consequence. Think of “grace” as a<strong> grace</strong>ful act: something benevolent that comes from the heart. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 10-12-2008(74): <strong>Grace</strong> is when you give from your <em>heart</em> to serve a higher <em>cause</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 27-5-2008(38): A<strong> grace</strong> is a gift whose only <em>cause</em> for being given comes from the <em>heart</em>. WARNING: Do not confuse with <a href="../721">graceful</a> <span class="index">(#721 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/淑">淑</a>)</span> - this kanji and it&#039;s meaning have nothing to do with being<strong> grace</strong>ful. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 5-1-2007(30): <strong>Grace</strong> Kelly died be<em>cause</em> of her <em>heart</em> condition. I.e., her <em>heart</em> was the <em>cause</em>. It was because of all that dancing... that&#039;s how the story goes. But really, what happened is that she accidentally locked in her St. Bernard for 5 days without food, and when she came back home he ripped out and swallowed her heart. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(16): The HEART is the CAUSE of <strong>graceful</strong> acts. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmlst79">jmlst79</a>] 16-8-2009(14): <strong>Grace</strong> will <em>cause</em> your <em>heart</em> to change. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wynterp">wynterp</a>] 3-9-2007(10): We say &quot;grace&quot; before our meal. The reason or <em>cause</em>? The<strong> grace</strong> we have received: remember &quot;utensil&quot; where all those hungry mouths were waiting to dig into the <em>St. Bernard</em> on the table? Well, those utensils have arrived and the dog is now on his way into our <em>mouths</em> which <em>causes</em> gratitude to well up from our <em>hearts</em>. (I imagine the &quot;grace&quot; is quickly spoken with the doggie already halfway to our mouth.). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PrettyKitty">PrettyKitty</a>] 8-5-2008(9): &quot;T&#039;was<strong> grace</strong> that caused my heart to sing.&quot; (Altered lyrics for Amazing<strong> Grace</strong>). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 6-8-2011(8): She had the<strong> grace</strong> to support every good <em>cause</em> with her full <em>heart</em>.
