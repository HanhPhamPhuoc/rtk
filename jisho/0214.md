heisig: "Without much effort, the elements <i>relax</i> . . . <i>tree</i> suggest a hammock strung between two <i>trees</i> in your backyard, and you stretched out in it, hands folded behind your head, <b>planning</b> something or other. After all, it's something we all do from time to time: kick up our legs on the nearest piece of furniture and daydream about the best <b>plan</b> of action to take. Be sure to relate the <i>relaxation</i> to the <i>tree</i>, so that you don't end up with something else in its place (like &quot;legs&quot; or &quot;desk&quot; or &quot;table&quot;)."
