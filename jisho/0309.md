heisig: "<b>Cram schools</b> are after-hours educational institutions where kids can do concentrated preparing for their coming entrance examinations or drill what they missed during regular class hours. The exception are the <i>tall children</i> who are out on the school <i>grounds</i> practicing sports, and the <i>fat</i> ones who are out there burning off calories. So this character depicts those who do NOT go to the <b>cram schools</b>, rather than those who do."
