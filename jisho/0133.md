## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beeber">Beeber</a>] 12-6-2007(238): I find it<strong> strange</strong> that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train. To me when I look at this kanji, I see a train just about to come out of a tunnel, and above the man waiting for his oppourtunity where he can end it all.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 30-7-2007(77): Imagine a ST. BERNARD DOG carrying a CAN instead of a barrel in rescue missions. How<strong> strange</strong>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 12-12-2007(58): A <em>dog</em> that <em>can</em> do the &quot;Can Can&quot; would be a<strong> STRANGE</strong> sight indeed.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shishimai">Shishimai</a>] 22-1-2006(26): It&#039;s &#039;strange&#039; to see a St. Bernard driving &#039;The Little Engine That Could&#039;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 20-8-2008(18): A <em>St. Bernard</em> that <em>can</em> eat <em>nails</em>?! How<strong> strange</strong>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 12-5-2008(18): <strong>Strange</strong> - that is when a big dog can stand on top of can.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hazyjazy">hazyjazy</a>] 25-10-2008(16): Big things can be<strong> strange</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 29-7-2008(13): This may sound<strong> STRANGE</strong> but if you think <em>big</em> you <em>can</em> do it!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 14-4-2009(12): Pamela Anderson. Her <em>big</em> <em>cans</em> just look<strong> strange</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epangelia2k2">epangelia2k2</a>] 11-9-2007(11): What a staggeringly<strong> strange</strong> sight. &#039;The Little Engine That <em>Can</em> (Could)&#039; is still climbing the hill, but now instead of a whistle there is a <em>large St. Bernard</em> perched on the cab. <strong>WOOF * WOOF</strong>.
