## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 17-12-2006(178): The <em>drooping</em> <em>citywalls</em> was generating a lot of angry <strong>mail</strong> for the city officials.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan">tomusan</a>] 27-11-2010(86): The <em>city walls</em> <em>droop</em> down in one spot so that the<strong> mail</strong>man can throw the<strong> mail</strong> over.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-3-2007(30): <em>Droopy Dog</em> delivers the <strong>mail</strong> by walking along the <em>city walls</em> and throwing it to the people below.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/coverup">coverup</a>] 17-2-2009(20): The <em>drooping</em> <em>citywalls</em> was generating a lot of angry <strong>mail</strong> for the city officials. Hint: think &quot;hate<strong> mail</strong>&quot; and you will remember this one. [thx CharleyGarrett].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/swiftman">swiftman</a>] 26-8-2009(10): <strong>Mail</strong> never gets delivered correctly in the <em>slum</em> ... the<strong> mail</strong>man is too busy <em>drooping</em> down so he doesn&#039;t get shot.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 26-4-2009(9): One of my favorite Simpsons moments: &quot;Hello, my name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.&quot; &quot;Okay Mr. Burns, what&#039;s your first name.&quot; &quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot; ........ After failing to retrieve <em>Mr. Burns&#039;</em><strong> mail</strong>, Homer <em>droops</em> on the steps in front of the post office.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aikou">Aikou</a>] 18-9-2006(8): In ancient times, <strong>post</strong> was a tricky business, because of the many looters. They arranged huge bags, that were <em>drooping</em> from the <em>city walls</em>. So whenever there was <strong>post</strong> from a different city, they put the <strong>post</strong> into this bag, so there was no need to open the city doors, so no intruders could come in.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 28-12-2012(7): <strong>Mail</strong>man <em>droops</em> under load with all the<strong> mail</strong> to be delivered within the <em>city walls</em> (don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../1858">parcel post</a> (#1858 逓)).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 21-1-2008(7): For UK residents: The reason the<strong> mail</strong> is always late/lost, droopy postal workers are employed within the city walls.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 20-8-2009(6): Even the<strong> mail</strong> staff and the letters themselves look like they&#039;re <em>drooping</em> when they go into the <em>slums</em>. (I imagine kind of a sad bent envelope, and the people around in the slums just as sad).
