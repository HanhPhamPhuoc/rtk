## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-2-2007(34): The <strong>city walls</strong> are beautifully built. High above you, shows you the famous <em>mouth</em>s of former city mayors, all smiling down at you, integrated into a total <em>mosaic</em> making the <strong>city walls</strong> a unified beautiful work of art.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 25-7-2009(21): I stand outside the<strong> city walls</strong>, requesting permission to enter. The guard hands me a Rubik&#039;s cube and tells me ill only be allowed in after I fit the whole thing in my mouth...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 12-1-2009(4): The only way to pass through these<strong> city walls</strong> is through this secured <em>mouth</em> here. You have to solve a <em>rubik&#039;s cube</em> for it to open.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 13-3-2010(3): The<strong> city walls</strong> had a lovely <em>mosaic</em> design. However, they also had defensive features including <em>openings</em> above through which boiling oil could be poured or cannons fired.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 15-5-2009(2): In Murakami&#039;s &#039;End of the World&#039; scenario, the only way to escape the<strong> city walls</strong> was via the <em>mouth</em> of the river, which the Dreamreader found by piecing his thoughts together like a <em>mosaic</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 15-7-2010(1): As you enter and exit by the<strong> city walls</strong> the <em>mosaic</em> has a talking <em>mouth</em> that says hello and goodbye.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 25-5-2009(1): A <em>mouth</em> saying from the top of the <strong>city walls</strong>: &quot;You have to solve a riddle (<em>mosaik</em>) if you want to come in. Here is, my <em>Rubik&#039;s cube</em>. If you can solve it - you are allowed to come in!&quot; But you chose a different way and throw the <em>cube</em> back into his <em>mouth</em>. The guard tumbles from the<strong> city walls</strong>. &quot;Solved!&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 3-10-2011(): There is a secret way inside the city that few know about. Find the right place in the <strong>city walls</strong> and press a <em>Rubik&#039;s cube</em> through the hidden <em>mouth</em> (which is located a little bit above you) to activate a lever and have a passageway open up to you, allowing you passage.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 25-1-2009(): The<strong> city walls</strong> are mounted with <em>2 headed snakes</em> with their <em>mouths</em> wide open.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nussram">nussram</a>] 30-12-2012(): The<strong> city walls</strong> are covered in a huge <em>mosaic.</em> Someone is stealing the pieces by ripping them out with his <em>mouth.</em> (He’s standing atop the walls and taking them from the top; that’s why the ‘mouth’ primitive is where it is.).
