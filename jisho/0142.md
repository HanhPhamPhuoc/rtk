heisig: "With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see <i>water</i> and <i>meadow</i> in this character for <b>source</b>. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word &quot;surge&quot;) and in popular usage, <b>source</b> suggests the place <i>water</i> comes from. In this kanji, it is under the <i>meadow</i>, where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little <i>springs</i>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogen2">dogen2</a>] 17-3-2007(146): The <em>water</em> that flows from the <em>meadow</em> is the <strong>source</strong> of life for the wild antelope. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 14-8-2006(74): The<strong> source</strong> of clean <em>water</em> is from the <a href="../134">meadow</a> <span class="index">(#134 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/原">原</a>)</span>: it comes from that <em>spring</em> at the bottom of the <em>cliff</em>. Pay no attention to Julie Andrews lying face down in <em>spring</em>. The water&#039;s clean. Trust me. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer">mdspencer</a>] 11-2-2009(65): <em>Water</em> is the<strong> source</strong> of a <em>meadow</em>&#039;s beauty. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 11-11-2007(31): Here the<strong> SOURCE</strong> of water is deep beneath the ground (<em>cliff</em>) - it seeps up, joins the water <em>springs</em>, flows through the meadow, and down the waterfall at the end. (NOTE- to keep <strong>spring</strong> (133) and<strong> source</strong> separate, remember that a spring can be anywhere above ground; but the<strong> source</strong> of water is deep beneath the ground (<em>cliff</em>), and flows up through the ground to join springs and streams - which is why there are two primitives for <em>water</em> in this kanji). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 20-5-2007(23): Bottled <em>water</em> companies assure us that the<strong> source</strong> of their water is from some beautiful <em>meadow</em>-spring in the Swiss Alps, but we all know they just bottle up tap water. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/littleblue">littleblue</a>] 28-6-2007(17): The<strong> source</strong> of this water is the spring under the cliff. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephjapan2004">stephjapan2004</a>] 25-10-2007(13): The<strong> SOURCE</strong> of the WATER is in the MEADOW. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mandazor">Mandazor</a>] 25-6-2009(5): The<strong> source</strong> of the <em>water</em> is the <em>meadow</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PositronLaser">PositronLaser</a>] 22-12-2008(5): WATER is the<strong> source</strong> of life for the MEADOW. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shock222">Shock222</a>] 9-3-2012(4): The<strong> source</strong> of water is the origin of all life.
