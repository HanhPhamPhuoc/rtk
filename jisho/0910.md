## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-6-2007(519): The<strong> rice plant</strong> is common in Japan because all the <em>wheat</em> was eaten by <em>vultures</em> in the <em>olden times</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 4-3-2007(44): It used to be that <em>wheat</em> was grown in Japan. However, this was often stolen by <em>vultures</em>, so in <em>olden times</em>, the gods gave the Japanese the<strong> rice plant</strong>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/altape">altape</a>] 2-1-2008(20): The<strong> rice plant</strong> evolved from wheat in olden times to defend itself against vultures eating it - rice causes vultures to explode. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rooboy">Rooboy</a>] 1-4-2009(10): Wheat has been trying to claw its way in to japan since olden times but the<strong> rice plant</strong> still domiantes the landscape. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 9-12-2008(8): What we are calling wheat really refers to a<strong> rice plant</strong>, known to Wolverine from olden times (Wolverine is a lot older than he looks -- he was born in the 1880s). Imagine Wolverine in ancient times (mukashi mukashi) planting rice by poking a little hole with his claws and then settling the plant into the mud. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 22-11-2009(6): In <em>olden times</em> it was found that wild <em>vultures</em> would attack <em>wheat</em> so they switched to <strong>rice</strong>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 11-11-2005(6): Japan doesn&#039;t have wheat, which is why they eat the seed of the<strong> rice plant</strong>. But they used to have it, in olden times, until a greedy flock of vultures came along and ate the entire crop, causing a change to the national staple food. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drivers99">drivers99</a>] 9-6-2009(5): Do a google image search for &quot;rice plant&quot; while you read this. There is the part that has the grains, called a panicle. This is similar to wheat. Then there are the leaves, which curve downward a look like the talons of a vulture. Then the roots. Just picture olden times with grainy sepia toned footage of peasants planting<strong> rice plant</strong>s in the paddy by holding onto the roots and sticking them into the field. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 20-1-2008(4): In the old days wolvie used to harvest wheat with his claws in Canada, whearing his straw hat and red lumberers shirt. Now, he is in Japan cultivating<strong> rice plant</strong>s in Japanese style clothes. SHNIK three holes in the ground, some seeds,... 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aodeur">aodeur</a>] 6-4-2011(3): Die <strong>Reispflanze</strong> ist in Japan so verbreitet, weil der ganze <em>Weizen</em> von <em>Geiern</em> gefressen wurde, in den <em>alten Zeiten</em>. (danke radical_tyro).
