## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 28-11-2008(71): I couldn&#039;t find any reference to this kanji as meaning<strong> cleanse</strong>. It seems to be most often used in the following compound 沙汰 （さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to &#039;select&#039; so maybe Heisig meant<strong> cleanse</strong> in the ethnic sense here.. I&#039;m going to use the keyword &quot;selection&quot;, as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(27): <em>Water</em> is used to<strong> cleanse</strong> a <em>plump</em> man&#039;s colon.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brendanmacdonald">brendanmacdonald</a>] 29-9-2008(13): If you are FAT, it takes more WATER to<strong> CLEANSE</strong> you.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 27-4-2008(6): The <a href="../120">plump</a> (#120 太) goes one a <strong>cleansing</strong> diet to restore his health. Each day he drinks his 3l of <em>water</em>, swim half a hour in <em>water</em>...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 5-8-2009(4): The very plump man selected the Japanese toilet seat which will<strong> cleanse</strong> him with water automatically since he&#039;s too fat to reach back and wipe... (consider herman&#039;s explanation and think of &quot;selection&quot;).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 27-10-2010(3): 手持ち無沙汰 , ご無沙汰 , 沙汰 , 淘汰 <a href="../2316">cleanse</a> (#2316 汰) タ( 太 ) ... Parts:氵, 太 <a href="../120">plump</a> (#120 太) ... Similar: 浄土 <a href="../1155">clean</a> (#1155 浄), 沙汰 <a href="../2316">cleanse</a> (#2316 汰) ... Story: The Pacific Ocean ( 太平洋 ) routinely sweeps <em>Water</em> over low lying islands <strong>Cleansing</strong> them of human traces. (it&#039;s a weird sort of 淘汰 (natural selection).).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 1-9-2009(3): If you listen to what people <strong>select</strong> at restaurants, it&#039;s seldom <em>water</em> for the <em>plump</em> man.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 7-4-2012(2): Futuristic genetic <strong>cleansing</strong> by using tiny sprays of <em>water</em> to wash out sperm carrying the genes for <em>plump</em>ness.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/doviende">doviende</a>] 21-10-2011(2): (occurs in the word for <strong>incident</strong>/<strong>affair</strong>.) When the <em>plump</em> guy tried to<strong> cleanse</strong> himself at the public bath, it was a strange <strong>incident</strong> because he splashed all the <em>water</em> out.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/truando">truando</a>] 27-11-2010(2): I use <strong>incident</strong>: 沙汰 【さた】 (n,vs) (1) affair; state; incident; issue; matter; 内沙汰 【うちざた】 (n) secret government business. STORY: There was an embarassing <strong>incident</strong> at a state reception : a <em>plump</em> woman, an official guest from Fidji, fell into the <em>water</em> of the fountain in front of the government building because someone had forgotten to remove a bench on the red carpet.
