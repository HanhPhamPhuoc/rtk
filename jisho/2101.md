Note: Heisig got this backwards. It is <strong>shalt not</strong>. But it is an unused Kanji anyway, so..It means the same thing as 勿 <a href="../1049">not</a> (#1049 勿). ... Story: Thou<strong> Shalt</strong> not argue with RTK keywords, or angry mobs will put you in <strong>Graveyards</strong> ... 熟語 : 莫逆 , 落莫 , ... cf: 慕う , 幕府 , 漢字 .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 17-4-2007(4): Ever notice how all of the tombstones in a graveyard LOOK like the 10 Commandments? &quot;Though<strong> shalt</strong> not this &#039;n that&quot; Scary stuff, which is why I<strong> shalt</strong> not visit there again!
