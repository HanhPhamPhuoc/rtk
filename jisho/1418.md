## Reading:

### On-Yomi: チツ

## Heisig story:

Hole . . . climax.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 1-7-2006(347): Sticking a<strong> plug up</strong> your hole will lead to stronger climaxes.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain+Kanjipants">Captain+Kanjipants</a>] 7-8-2011(187): I&#039;m pretty sure Heisig wrote the whole book just so he could make this joke.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 6-12-2007(102): Here we have a Hole and Climax to mean<strong> PLUG UP</strong>. This is so butt-f**king easy, pun intended. If you<strong> PLUG UP</strong> her Hole, she will Climax.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danno">Danno</a>] 22-7-2009(83): I just think its hilarious how many stories are getting reported for this character. Come on!! what else could it be! How better to remember it ? Prudes please get over yourselves. If someone has a good story, just because you are easily offended, doesn&#039;t mean someone else( the majority ) won&#039;t find it useful. planning to be missionaries in Japan with all your Kanji skillz ? If you find this offensive...hahahaha. You will get a shock when you see your first KONBINI magazine shelf.LMAO..i gotsreported.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 11-11-2008(41): My girlfriend <strong>plugs up</strong> her <strong>ちつ</strong>(vagina 膣) <em>hole</em> to <em>climax</em>! This Kanji&#039;s on-yomi is pronounced &#039;<strong>ちつ</strong>&#039; (チツ) // zhi4 질 (jil) 절 (jeol).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 22-4-2008(41): Yet another Freudian kanji -<strong> plug up</strong> a <em>hole</em>, and the result is <em>climax</em>. Do we really need to spell this out any more explicitly? Don&#039;t mix up with <a href="../264">plug</a> (#264 栓).<strong> Plug up</strong> has a slightly more sexual connotation.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-10-2005(28): A zen monk tries to<strong> plug up</strong> a <em>hole</em> in the wall, because noises coming from next door prevents him to reach a <em>climax</em> of concentration (see frame 753 &quot;climax&quot;).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 22-9-2008(24): If there&#039;s a big <em>hole</em> where the <em>roof</em> of your <em>room</em> used to be, you&#039;d better find something to <strong>plug</strong> it <strong>up</strong> real fast. (Hurray for a non-lewd story!).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 5-3-2010(15): As already noted by shang,<strong> plug up</strong> is not good key word choice. It&#039;s easily confused with <a href="../264">plug</a> (#264 栓) but it does appear in the rare word 窒塞 blocked. Most common uses: 窒素 (ちっそ) &#039;nitrogen&#039; and 窒息 (ちっそく) &#039;suffocation&#039;. STORY: <strong>Nitrogen</strong> vapour is an oxygen displacer. Where liquid nitrogen is stored, steps must be taken to ensure adequate ventilation. If all the <em>holes</em> in the room are <strong>plugged up</strong> the <em>climax</em> to our story will be <strong>suffocation</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 1-3-2011(12): <strong>Plug up</strong> her <em>hole</em> until <em>climax</em> (don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../264">plug</a> (#264 栓)).
