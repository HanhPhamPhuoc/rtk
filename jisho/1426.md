## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 21-11-2007(202): To me, this looks like a pictograph of a road leading to the big city (see the buildings?) where there are plenty of places to be<strong> entertain</strong>ed. Unfortunately in this city, every store is the <em>same: staples</em>. What <em>tools</em>! [ayoung24].

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 27-8-2007(90): Photographically, this kanji simply looks like a set of two speakers (the staples primitives) between the sub-woofer (primitive for same) -- all this as a tool to<strong> entertain</strong> a group of drunks at a club.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac">aphasiac</a>] 9-9-2010(39): Wacky Japanese TV <strong>entertain</strong>-ment show: a <em>monk</em> is <em>stapled</em> to the wall on both sides with huge <em>staples</em>, whilst contestants throw <em>tools</em> at his face.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 12-12-2008(34): This is a pictograph an <strong>entertainment</strong> system (two speakers left and right of the main unit, which has a CD slot and a tape deck) on a table-top.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 23-9-2008(24): Whenever I go to <em>Staples</em> I end up looking at the <em>same tools</em> every time (PDAs, printers, etc.) but it manages to<strong> entertain</strong> me.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 4-9-2006(21): To me, this looks like a pictograph of a road leading to the big city (see the buildings?) where there are plenty of places to be<strong> entertain</strong>ed.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(11): Wow, this looks like the pictograph of an <strong>entertain</strong>ment system! See the basses on each side, the main stereo box in the middle, and the table? <strong>Entertain</strong> yourself with this image, but it&#039;s a good idea to go with a story instead of a pictograph. My story: I like <em>staples</em>, so I always <em>staple</em> the <em>same</em> thing twice as a <em>tool</em> to <strong>entertain</strong> myself with. It has become a habit.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 29-1-2008(10): <strong>Entertain</strong>ment in the Dark Ages: on a <em>workbench</em> type platform, stick a corrupt <em>monk</em> in an Iron Maiden (<em>staples</em> on either side).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 1-3-2009(9): People find EA games <strong>entertaining</strong>, even though every game is the <em>same</em> shit <em>stapled</em> together using only very basic development <em>tools</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 21-1-2010(6): To<strong> entertain</strong> themselves the <em>monks</em> fire <em>staple</em>s at each other. &quot;Hey, those are meant to be <em>tools</em>, not for your<strong> entertain</strong>ment!&quot;, you shout.
