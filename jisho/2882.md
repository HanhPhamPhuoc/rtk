## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 8-1-2007(46): <strong>Incandescent</strong> red is naturally twice as bright as ordinary red ( 赤 ). Alternatively, this is a picture of spreading (already doubled),<strong> incandescent</strong> red fire. Note: This is used by far most commonly to write 赫 (あか)い, although dictionaries do not recognize such a reading (except for kanji dictionaries).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SimHuman">SimHuman</a>] 21-1-2010(9): <strong>Incandescent</strong> light bulbs work by passing an electric current through a filament, heating it so it produces light by incandescence. When you think of something heating up so it glows, it usually turns red (toaster coils, embers, etc.). An<strong> incandescent</strong> bulb is much brighter, so it&#039;s DOUBLE RED.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(3): <em>Rosy cheeks</em> are<strong> incandescent</strong>, glowing red with heat.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 11-3-2011(2): 嚇々たる =赫々たる, 嚇怒する =赫怒する <a href="../2908">incandescent</a> (#2908 赫) カク( 嚇 ) ... Parts: 赤 , 赤 (cf. 嚇す <a href="../2026">menacing/upbraid</a> (#2026 嚇)) ... Note: means, reads the same as 嚇 <a href="../2026">menacing/upbraid</a> (#2026 嚇) ... Story: <em>Double Red</em> filaments in a <strong>Incandescent</strong> bulb, as opposed to RED lighting (get it?).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 10-3-2010(1): Strike the <em>red</em> tip of a match against the <em>reddish</em> brown side of the box and the tip will glow<strong> incandescent</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 20-1-2010(1): At a blacksmith&#039;s shop iron will turn an<strong> INCANDESCENT</strong> RED which is doubly bright. One RED is from the heat within, the other RED reflects the fire without.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 9-11-2009(1): <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> is<strong> incandescent</strong> when she discovers that she&#039;s not one of kind, but in fact has a clone. Both Red Riding Hoods, from whom the secret has been kept, turn an<strong> incandescent</strong> shade of red upon hearing the news.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimitha">jimitha</a>] 7-11-2009(1): A pictograph of the scene in Top Secret! the movie, where Hillary Flammond&#039;s breasts glow an<strong> incandescent</strong> <em>red</em>. See <a href="http://i37.tinypic.com/ot2334.jpg">http://i37.tinypic.com/ot2334.jpg</a> .

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/faneca">faneca</a>] 1-7-2012(): [See <a href="../1743">red</a> (#1743 赤): <strong>Red Primitive</strong>: When it conserves its shape (it conserves the top cross) =&gt; <em>International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement</em>]. <strong>Story:</strong> After the spying accusations (see <a href="../1744">pardon</a> (#1744 赦)), the local population started to commercialize special<strong> incandescent</strong> <em>Red Cross/Red Crescent</em> flags, so to protest against them they only have to rub two of them and <strong>suddenly</strong> the flags <strong>light up</strong> by themselves (no <em>fire</em> needed).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sowhatsitallaboutthen">sowhatsitallaboutthen</a>] 17-6-2012(): An<strong> incandescent</strong> bulb gives off a warm red light. in fact, they give off about DOUBLE the amount of RED light , as florescent bulbs, which are more of a green colour.
