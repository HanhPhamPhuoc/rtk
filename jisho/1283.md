## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 18-9-2006(250): Note: this word in Japanese has the idea of &quot;indignant&quot;. So<strong> aroused</strong> here refers to being<strong> aroused</strong> because of anger over some unjust or wrong act, unfairness etc. It doesn&#039;t seem to carry a meaning associated with arousal in the sense of sex or pleasure. So, my story: think of the angry <em>state of mind</em><strong> aroused</strong> at finding all your <em>clams</em> buried under your <em>haystack</em> stolen, gone!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 25-10-2007(68): <em>Data</em> was <strong>aroused/indignant</strong> when he saw what the volcano had done to the farmers building their <em>haystacks</em> and the fishermen collecting their <em>shells</em> . The tragedy of it all <strong>aroused</strong> him so much he didn&#039;t even notice he was feeling emotion.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 24-9-2007(31): <strong>Aroused</strong>: the state of mind men are in <em>before</em> their eruption...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 20-12-2007(24): Oh boy, does <em>bearded clam</em> ever work for this kanji! I get into an<strong> aroused</strong> state just thinking about it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 20-11-2008(10): After <em>Data</em> got his emotion chip, his anger was<strong> aroused</strong> when he realized he wasn&#039;t getting any of that <em>bearded clam</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 7-1-2008(7): This kanzi does not have much to do with sexuality. It has more to do with being angry. 憤る 【いきどおる】 (v5r,vi) to be angry; to resent; to be enraged; to be indignant 憤る 【むずかる】 (v5r,vi) to fret; to be fretful; to be peevish. STORY: I just used joesan&#039;s story and changed the keyword.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 11-11-2012(6): Her <em>wild state of mind</em> became<strong> aroused</strong> upon finding out that he had that much <em>money</em> lay hidden under the <em>haystack</em>f (don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../526">rouse</a> (#526 起)).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Artur83">Artur83</a>] 16-4-2009(6): Wie war wohl die <em>Gemütslage</em> der Ätnaanreiner, die bei der Eruption Haus und Hof verloren, weil der <em>Heuschutzwall</em> aus Rahmen 1197 nichts brachte? Klar, <strong>empört</strong> waren sie.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 15-5-2010(4): (RHS of Kanji = Sea Urchin) When a sea urchin&#039;s state of mind changes to angry or<strong> aroused</strong>, its needles stand out on end. Picture a really pissed off sea urchin.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paramausi">paramausi</a>] 24-6-2009(3): <em>Data</em> is<strong> aroused</strong> because someone hid all his <em>shells</em> below a <em>haystack</em>.
