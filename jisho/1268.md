## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 14-2-2007(222): <em>Maestro</em>, coattails flapping wildly, is being <strong>chase</strong>d down the <em>road</em> by his fans. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sleepyday">sleepyday</a>] 26-10-2008(51): This Kanji reminds me of Nodame Cantabile. I just have to imagine Chiaki, our <em>maestro</em> in training, getting<strong> chase</strong>d by Nodame down the <em>road</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 8-4-2007(50): <em>Maestro</em> primative = <em>James Bond</em>. Here he gives<strong> chase</strong> down the <em>road</em> to the bad guys. I&#039;m thinking of the car<strong> chase</strong> in &#039;The Man with the Golden Gun&#039; - NOT <a href="../539">pursue</a> <span class="index">(#539 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/逐">逐</a>)</span>. I think about &#039;Race N<strong> Chase</strong>&#039; (a scalextric type toy)...there were no pigs in &#039;Race N<strong> Chase</strong>&#039;, only cars. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 2-3-2011(33): I&#039;m going to use Beyonce as the primitive meaning. She&#039;s a bit of a musical maestro herself AND she has an amazing butt, so all the bases are covered. Plus the radical looks like a &#039;B&#039;! So this kanji is a pictograph of me <strong>chasing</strong> gorgeous <em>Beyonce</em> down the <em>road</em>. Mmm, Beyonce! (drool).   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/追う">追う</a>   おう run after, drive out;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/追い付く">追い付く</a>   おいつく overtake, catch up (with);   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/追放">追放</a>   ついほう banishment, exile;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/追加">追加</a>   ついか supplement, addition. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jslindst">jslindst</a>] 6-3-2009(9): I use Bond for the Maestro (the primitive also resembles B). Here you see James <em>Bond</em> being<strong> chase</strong>d on a road. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 1-8-2006(8): <em>Maestro</em> has but to see the <em>road</em> to hear the great <strong>chase</strong> scene music he will create! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 29-3-2009(6): Believing he&#039;s being<strong> chase</strong>d, <em>Beethoven</em> (the <em>maestro</em> with more than just a <em>drop</em> of lead poisoning), runs down the <em>road</em>, a sad victim of deafness and mental illness. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven#Loss_of_hearing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven#Loss_of_hearing</a>). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazato">wazato</a>] 4-3-2010(5): I will use Seinfeld for the maestro primitive. It&#039;s easy if you ever saw that episode (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maestro">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maestro</a>). For the<strong> chase</strong> primitive, Kramer is being<strong> chase</strong>d down the road after the guy he was betting on airplanes with thought that he was cheating. The guy was a big, Texan okanemochi type and was really pissed when he thought Kramer was cheating on the bets. Picture Kramer running down the street with those longs legs and crazy hair. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmcanally">jmcanally</a>] 19-1-2010(4): Bouncing butt Beyonce is being<strong> chase</strong>d by fans down the street. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sskaggs">sskaggs</a>] 5-8-2011(3): Mnemonic: Heres the maestro, on the road, his baton in perfect rhythm. --- It&#039;s his bad first try with a marching band, --- see him<strong> chase</strong> instead of lead them.
