## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/henroski">henroski</a>] 6-2-2008(226): The PART of my HEAD where I remember the KANJI is in the kanji<strong> PARTITION</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 22-11-2006(129): The last time I tried to<strong> partition</strong> a hard drive under Linux, I got a severe migraine that parted my head. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 22-5-2007(40): There are different <em>parts</em> of the <em>head</em> and they each have their own<strong> partition</strong>s: the corpus callosum, the different hemispheres, etc. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(24): The head is<strong> partition</strong>ed into parts. Thinking of the head as a “hard drive” (where all the information we know is stored) we may imagine the head being<strong> partition</strong>ed just like a 3D pie chart. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 10-1-2008(18): Ｔｈｉｎｋ　ｂａｃｋ　ｔｏ　８２　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/項、">項、</a>  the craft of starting a paragraph. This time you want to<strong> partition</strong> the page instead so add   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/分">分</a>  　part to the front instead. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow">cornrow</a>] 24-11-2008(16): A<strong> partition</strong> is the <em>part</em> of the drive that the <em>head</em> writes to. Nerd. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jombo">Jombo</a>] 17-2-2012(8): Remember <a href="../135">petition</a> <span class="index">(#135 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/願">願</a>)</span>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/願">願</a>  . Its not petition, its<strong> PARTition</strong>. Stuck in your <em>head</em> yet? 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 8-11-2008(8): I used to speak French, but after I started learning Japanese the French<strong> partition</strong> of my head got filled up with Japanese and now I can&#039;t speak it anymore! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drivers99">drivers99</a>] 28-5-2009(7): (for geeks only)<strong> Partition</strong> the hard drive into multiple <em>parts</em> in order to minimize seek and delay times of the drive <em>heads</em> during <em>paging</em>. Not really an issue with solid state drives because they don&#039;t have <em>heads</em>, and so don&#039;t need<strong> partition</strong>s. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 27-7-2008(7): My head is like a hard drive, with many <strong>partitions</strong>, each a different <em>part</em> in my <em>head</em>.
