heisig: "The pieces in this character should be easily recognizable: on the left, the element for <i>part of the body</i>, and on the right, the character for <i>nightbreak</i>, which we have just met. What all of this has to do with the <b>gall bladder</b> is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the <b>gall bladder</b> is supposed to filter out), and change it to &quot;not letting the <i>night break</i> on your anger&quot; (or your <b>gall</b>) - and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed by letting the sun set on it and then &quot;sleeping it off.&quot;"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smiro">smiro</a>] 11-11-2007(279): The moon has a lot of gall sticking around after sunrise.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arturo">arturo</a>] 20-7-2007(124): All the <em>month</em> long I have to start working at <em>nightbreak</em>. This really activates my<strong> gall bladder</strong> (=I get angry).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/randomassortmentofletters">randomassortmentofletters</a>] 31-5-2009(88): For a month（ 月 ）, I was up until nightbreak（ 旦 ） because of my<strong> gall bladder</strong>（ 胆 ）.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yaban">yaban</a>] 15-1-2007(49): The<strong> gall bladder</strong> digests the flesh (meat) before nightbreak so you are ready to start your new day.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra">LeoOra</a>] 14-1-2008(26): If you drink all night long (moon), until the night break your<strong> gall bladder</strong> will have problems...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta">Dualta</a>] 7-10-2007(25): You&#039;ve got some gall calling around here every month after night break!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 11-1-2012(24): The<strong> gall bladder</strong> is the <em>part of the body</em> that secretes bile, mostly after <em>night break</em>, to help digest fat eaten during dinner.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cezaria">cezaria</a>] 3-8-2008(13): According to the chinese medicine the<strong> gall bladder</strong> comes to its activity between 23h and 01h, so it is between night (when moon cames) and nightbreak.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 15-4-2008(10): Ah, the <strong>GALL BLADDER</strong>. Heisig certainly has <strong>gall</strong> putting it this early in his book! Wikipedia says it&#039;s the <em>part of the body</em> which stores gall until you need it to digest fatty foods; say, at <em>nightbreak</em> (ah, that fatty full English breakfast!).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/boadicea">boadicea</a>] 17-8-2009(8): After a long night, at night break, time to empty a GAL&#039;S BLADDER.
