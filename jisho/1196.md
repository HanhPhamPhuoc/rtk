## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 11-12-2007(170): Hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> = a big <em>St. Bernard dog</em> frisking about in a <em>haystack</em>, knocking it down and spreading the hay about, after the field hands just stacked it up. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 30-10-2006(90): A<strong> bustle</strong> is also the name for the big wire-framed skirts that women used to wear. Here&#039;s a <em>St. Bernard dog</em> jammed ass-first into the top of a <em>haystack</em>, looking like some kind of proper Victorian-era lady as he struggles to get out. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 13-3-2008(73): (note: easier way to remember haystack - it&#039;s just as difficult to find a needle in a haystack, even if you use two hands) Farmers hustling and bustling to move big haystacks. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 9-3-2008(41): In the hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> of NYC, you suddenly find this humongous <em>haystack</em> and a giant <em>St. Bernard</em> sitting on top of it, howling Christmas songs. Nobody even stops to look....only in NYC. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imagia">imagia</a>] 27-8-2008(12): - I had trouble using the haystack primitive without &quot;money&quot; as in the following frames, so I&#039;ve separated the elements out to make sure I don&#039;t put &quot;money&quot; into this kanji. Whenever you come across any<strong> BUSTLE</strong>, there&#039;s a simple solution for getting through. Get your St Bernard and prick him with a needle - he&#039;ll cut right through the<strong> BUSTLE</strong>. You just have to hold onto him with two hands! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meeatcookies">meeatcookies</a>] 30-3-2012(8): Story for the haystack primitive: you&#039;re trying to find a <em>needle</em> in a haystack, with your <em>both hands</em>. For<strong> bustle</strong>: Farmers are <strong>bustling</strong> around and making a <em>big haystack</em> with the hay laying around. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxg">tritonxg</a>] 1-2-2010(6): [FR]<strong>se précipiter</strong> N1 <strong>HON</strong> k&amp;k:1659<em> st bernard+meule de foin</em> <strong>avalanche :</strong>on se PRECIPITE à la recherche des rescapés qui grâce au ST BERNARD ne sont pas une AIGUILLE dans une botte de FOIN   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/奔騰">奔騰</a>  【ほんとう】price jump  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/奔馬">奔馬</a>  【ほんば】galloping horse  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/奔流">奔流</a>  【ほんりゅう】violent stream  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/淫奔">淫奔</a>  【いんぽん】lasciviousness  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/不羈奔放">不羈奔放</a>  【ふきほんぽう】uninhibited  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/出奔">出奔</a>  【しゅっぽん】fuite  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/出奔者">出奔者</a>  【しゅっぽしゃ】fugitif  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/奔放">奔放</a>  【ほんぽう】wild,extravagant. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 22-1-2009(4): (based on matticus) A<strong> bustle</strong> is also the name for the big wire-framed skirts that women used to wear. So you can just see a <em>big</em><strong> bustle</strong> sticking out the top of the haystack, as the woman has dived in headfirst, (presumably looking for a needle with 2 hands) and got stuck. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 15-12-2008(4): Whats all this<strong> bustle</strong> just about a <em>big</em> <em>haystack</em>? Don&#039;t you people have more interesting things to carouse about? 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 29-5-2013(3): Tired of the hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> of the city? Go to the countryside. If you have never seen the<strong> bustle</strong> and fun of a country bumpkin game of find the <em>St. Bernard</em> in the <em>haystack</em> then you haven&#039;t lived my friends. Try it! (The <em>haystack</em> primitive here shows a <em>needle</em> being found and raised excitedly in the air with <em>two hands</em> by the finder. The <em>haystack</em> primitive is actually made from 3 <em>needles stacked</em> and only rarely, when no element is below, does it resemble <em>two hands</em>).
