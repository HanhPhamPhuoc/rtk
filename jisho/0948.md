## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyland1">Hyland1</a>] 14-10-2006(229): The temples in kyoto belt bamboo around trees in a<strong> scheme</strong> to protect them from the huge number of tourists. (true story)-----------  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/対策">対策</a>  　　たいさく　　measure, countermeasure. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 3-4-2008(122): (Elaboration of jameserb&#039;s story:) A clever <strong>scheme</strong> from Wile E Coyote -- he ties one of those rubber <em>belts</em> to some <em>trees</em> and uses it to launch a <em>bamboo</em> spear at the roadrunner... 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 23-3-2009(77): In Japan gardeners use a<strong> scheme</strong> to protect <em>tree</em>s by putting a <em>bamboo</em> <em>belt</em> around them. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-7-2008(25): I have trouble recalling this keyword, so I&#039;m going to employ the mnemonic: the &quot;Bamboo Belt<strong> Scheme</strong>.&quot; It&#039;s linked to a true story: In India, the gov&#039;t implemented a<strong> SCHEME</strong> to make use of the abundant <em>bamboo belt</em> in the north of the country. As compared to the hardwood <em>trees</em> there, bamboo is highly renewable and will create rural jobs in a push for 300% increase in bamboo production. There. Bamboo, not trees. It&#039;s in the<strong> scheme</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 3-9-2007(13): The<strong> scheme</strong> was to capture him, tie him to a <em>tree</em> with a <em>belt</em>, and whip him with the <em>bamboo</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 15-9-2009(10): I came up with a crazy<strong> scheme</strong>. You put a <em>belt</em> around a <em>tree</em>, and then when someone comes to look at it, you hit them on the head with a <em>bamboo</em> pole and take their money. It&#039;s gonna work! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jslindst">jslindst</a>] 17-2-2009(7): In the<strong> Scheme</strong> programming language parenthesis (bamboo belts) are used to surround (belt) compounds. You can create recursive trees in<strong> Scheme</strong>! 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 1-2-2007(4): Planting only <em>bamboo</em> to replace the <em>tree belt</em> of Central Africa, the evil multinational corporations have a<strong> scheme</strong> to log the entire rainforest. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 18-4-2010(3): Their<strong> scheme</strong> is to <em>belt</em> <em>bamboo</em> together like a <em>tree</em> and try to pass it off as wood. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 19-1-2010(3): Look, remember &#039;thorn&#039;? They realised (ancient Chinese) that there has to be a better<strong> scheme</strong> for making thorns. Wrapping a belt around a tree and rubbing it until little saber like chunks fall out isnt good enough. The best<strong> scheme</strong> is to do it to bamboo, because bamboo thorns are much stronger than standard bark. And thus allow for mass production since they grow so readily and quickly. So it&#039;s a great strategy for the thorn making company.
