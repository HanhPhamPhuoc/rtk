heisig: "Connoting the measurement of the depth of <i>water</i>, the keyword <b>fathom</b> begins with the <i>water</i> primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for <i>rule</i> (Frame 92) which we learned in the sense of a &quot;ruler&quot; or &quot;measure.&quot; Hence, when we <i>rule</i> <i>water</i> we <b>fathom</b> it. What could be simpler? But be careful; its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself <b>fathoming</b> a body of <i>water</i> several hundred feet deep by using a <i>ruler</i> of gargantuan proportions."
