1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wingedge">wingedge</a>] 22-12-2007(207): &quot;Sunglasses-missing-one-lens&quot; is obviously the <em>monocle</em>. The proper, high-class way to<strong> descend</strong> <em>The Pinnacle</em> is wearing a <em>monocle</em> with your <em>walking legs</em> splayed to a full gentlemanly stride.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 30-5-2007(33): After a cool, hip businessman angered the executives at <em>The Pinnacle</em>, they beat him up, popping out a lens from his <em>sunglasses</em>, and tossed out the window, head first, <em>walking legs</em> second.

(EDIT: fixed up primitives).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 19-5-2010(8): (NB: The so-called &quot;sunglasses with a lens popped out&quot;, ヰ, is the katakana for the now-obsolete syllable &quot;wi&quot;.) The <strong>DESCENT</strong> from the <em>PINNACLE</em> is both the most difficult and most exhilarating part of the walking race. The contestants<strong> DESCEND</strong> from the <em>PINNACLE</em>, their <em>WALKING LEGS</em> moving as fast as they can. The <em>WI</em>nner crosses the line screaming I &quot;<em>W-I-I-I-I-I-I-I</em>-n!&quot;.

But since it&#039;s a spiral staircase, only your outside eye is exposed to the sun, so you use a special pair of <strong>sunglasses</strong> with one lens popped out.
