heisig: "You have heard of people &quot;attaching&quot; themselves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a <b>Buddhist temple</b> with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused <i>land</i> around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with <i>glue</i>, steps down firmly, and so joins the <b>Buddhist temple</b> as a &quot;permanent member.&quot;"
