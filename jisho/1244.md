## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 19-12-2007(401): The hunter&#039;s <strong>boast</strong>: I <em>say</em>, it was a &quot;<em>big</em> <em>one</em>&quot;, but the <em>snare</em> broke and it got away. (credit to many others before). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 15-1-2008(65): A dog owner<strong> boast</strong>s about how obedient, not how smart, his <em>Saint Bernard</em> dog is. &quot;Why, my dog will even walk right into a trap if I tell him to. Watch!&quot; With a single <em>word</em>, &quot;go!&quot;, his dog obediently runs into a <em>snare</em> trap hanging from the <em>ceiling</em>. In a flash, the dog is netted tightly and swinging from the <em>ceiling</em>. Don&#039;t forget the <em>ceiling</em>! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo">ezmoreldo</a>] 14-4-2008(16): When you<strong> boast</strong> too much, your words cause your head to become so <em>big</em> it gets <em>snared</em> on the <em>ceiling</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret">Wosret</a>] 10-9-2008(10): His <strong>large</strong><strong> boast</strong>ful <strong>words</strong> <strong>snare</strong>d no <strong>one</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 26-11-2008(8): I&#039;m usually<strong> boast</strong>ing when I <em>say</em>, &quot;Yep, my <em>big one</em> usually <em>snares</em> the ladies.&quot; If only it were true... 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nagisa">nagisa</a>] 14-1-2008(6): A man<strong> boast</strong>s that with a single <em>word</em> of command his <em>st. bernard</em> can hang a <em>snare</em> from the <em>ceiling</em> - all by itself! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-5-2008(5): <em>Socrates</em> can be kinda morbid sometimes. Here he is <strong>boasting</strong> that he caught a huge <em>dog</em> out in the field somewhere. He dug a hole, put a massive <em>bear trap</em> on it, put a small wooden board over the top of it such that the claws were still showing (see how the board atop the <em>bear trap</em> is smaller than the <em>trap</em> itself?). He then waited for a while. The <em>dog</em> came out and was snapped up in the trap - but got away (with two less legs, though). The one that got away...classic, with a (morbid) twist. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kansaigaijin">kansaigaijin</a>] 20-8-2009(4): If your were able to <em>snare</em> a <em>St.Bernard</em> on the <em>ceiling</em>, their wouldn&#039;t be enough <em>words</em> to <strong>boast</strong>. More importantly, how the hell with the St. Bernard get up there. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 10-12-2009(3): His last<strong> boast</strong>ful <em>words</em> were, &quot;I can catch <em>large dogs</em> with just <em>one</em> simple <em>snare</em>&quot;. The next I heard a St Bernard had eaten him for breakfast. HINT: Primitive position - St Bernard prevailed so it is naturally on TOP. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/artax5005">artax5005</a>] 5-5-2013(2): Il cacciatore SPAVALDO, si VANTA con PAROLE di compiacimento per aver catturato il povero SAN BERNARDO, appeso al SOFFITTO con la sua TRAPPOLA. E se gli mandassimo a casa degli animalisti?
