## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joeyjpm">joeyjpm</a>] 15-7-2008(161): <em>Warning - naughty reminder</em> A woman in the doggie style position, waiting for my<strong> NINE</strong> inches.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gunii">Gunii</a>] 12-2-2008(157): Kinda of looks like the kanji of 1 一 with the kanji of 8 八 added. So think of it as <a href="http://google.com/#q=一＋八＝九">一＋八＝九</a> .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sharpstick">sharpstick</a>] 9-6-2007(50): It looks like an elaborate letter &quot;n&quot; for<strong> nine</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CaptainN">CaptainN</a>] 17-10-2008(24): Girl waiting in doggy-style position for her boyfriend. If only she knew back then she would get pregnant and would have to carry a baby for<strong> nine</strong> months!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 28-10-2007(21): <strong>Nine</strong> baseball players, bowing low on the ground on hands and knees, before the game starts. おねがいします！.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 26-12-2007(12): If you pay atention to the first stroke, and half the second one, you can see a katakana ナ, which stands for 「ナイン」 (piece of cake, isn&#039;t it?).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GrimPanda">GrimPanda</a>] 20-9-2010(10): <em>九i 九 e</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta">Dualta</a>] 25-2-2008(10): No. 10 got hooked, leaving only 9.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snispilbor">snispilbor</a>] 15-4-2008(9): Think of the<strong> Nine</strong> Ringwraiths from Lord of the Rings, and associate<strong> Nine</strong> with the similar-looking <em>Power</em> ( 力 ) . (I find <em>ringwraiths</em> to be a useful extra radical meaning for 九 sometimes).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MarkLG">MarkLG</a>] 10-8-2009(8): A man standing to the left, holding a 9 iron golf club.
