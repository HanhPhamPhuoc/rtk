## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 14-7-2007(111): The Column of 300 spartans were in a<strong> delicate</strong> situation. They had travelled in one line (using only their legs) to the mountain pass to face the fierce Persian task master.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold">cingold</a>] 18-9-2009(74): We&#039;re <em>going</em> up the <em>mountain</em> announces the <em>taskmaster</em>. Anyone with <em>legs</em> too<strong> delicate</strong> must stay behind.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 4-10-2007(63): [The sense of<strong> delicate</strong> implied by this Kanj -- easily broken, weak, brittle, insignificant] A <em>column</em> of <em>taskmasters</em> is trying to <em>leg</em>-press <em>one</em> <em>mountain</em> between them. They are old and frail, and their legs skinny and<strong> delicate</strong>. A <em>single</em> pair of <em>legs</em> wouldn&#039;t be able to achive anything in this case. However, together they manage to push the <em>mountain</em> up towards the sky.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 16-11-2008(38): Here we have a taskmaster who orders a <strong>mountain</strong> to <strong>go</strong> away. The mountain is so frightened that it sprouts two little<strong> delicate</strong> <strong>legs</strong> and gingerly walks away. Be sure to imagine the legs as really tiny and the mountain as really big so the<strong> delicate</strong>-ness is there.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 13-10-2007(19): The fellowship of the ring had to move as a <em>column</em> <strong>delicate</strong>ly through the mines of moria. The <em>mountain</em> was above them with <em>legs</em> hanging from the <em>ceiling</em>, no doubt left there by the <em>taskmaster</em> they didn&#039;t want to awaken.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 14-11-2009(16): (See my story for <a href="../887">indications</a> (#887 徴)) Her <em>legs</em> were too<strong> delicate</strong> for <em>trekking</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 8-7-2009(14): Learn this as a pair with <a href="../887">indications</a> (#887 徴). The deposed king, forced by the taskmaster to climb a mountain road, has very<strong> delicate</strong> legs...notice how one of the legs is broken and sort of dangling.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas">amthomas</a>] 15-3-2007(11): <em>The Flash</em> and the <em>taskmaster</em> have cornered a<strong> delicate</strong> <em>pair of legs</em> (sexy broad) under the <em>mountain</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kansaigaijin">kansaigaijin</a>] 8-3-2009(9): <em>Going</em> to a <em>mountain</em> called Everest, the <em>ceiling</em> of the world, on <em>human legs</em> and no <em>taskmaster</em> is a <strong>delicate</strong> odyssey and dance with death.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 27-7-2008(6): Remember the mountain king from <a href="../887">indications</a> (#887 徴)? Unfortunately they got there too late. Instead of the king, there were only <em>legs</em> from the <em>ceiling</em>. Someone will have to be very<strong> delicate</strong> when conveying the bad news to the queen.
