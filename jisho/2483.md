## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 15-4-2008(46): When you see<strong> bellflower</strong>s next to a <em>tree</em>, ring them for <em>good luck</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 16-10-2006(9): When you see<strong> bellflower</strong>s growing under a <em>tree</em>, it means <em>good luck</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 13-7-2010(6): If you&#039;re climbing a <em>tree</em>, it&#039;s <em>good luck</em> to bring a<strong> bellflower</strong> with you, because then if you get stuck you can ring it to call for help.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gwindarr">Gwindarr</a>] 13-6-2008(1): Alright, the<strong> bellflower</strong> tree has no flowers and no bells. In place of these are aerosol cans which bloom out of the tree and occasionally clink together which must be how the tree got its name.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 9-2-2011(): We used to have lots of <em>trees</em> and<strong> bellflower</strong>s in our home in Sydney. It was great until someone came with an aerosol can and destroyed everything.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 23-4-2010(): I was &quot;saved by the <strong>BELL</strong>&quot;-<strong>FLOWER</strong> <em>TREE</em>, or, more precisely, by its miraculous medicinal powers, so I owe to it the <em>GOOD LUCK</em> of being still alive.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 26-5-2008(): <em>Good luck</em> to find a <strong>flower</strong> when all you see and hear are <em>trees</em> and <strong>bells</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 19-5-2008(): Tree, aerosol can: I use my special <em>aerosol can</em>. It can send out ringing bells, that become flowers after a few seconds. The can said &#039;<strong>bellflower</strong>&#039;. So, I climbed up the <em>tree</em> to spray them on some passers-by. However, they were not amused since some of the bells did not turn into flowers...

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(): As a <em>tree</em> looks bare I use my <em>aerosol</em> to spray<strong> bellflower</strong>s all over it (as soon as I finish they all start dinging).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-6-2007(): For <em>good luck</em>, I plucked a<strong> bellflower</strong> from the tree with the intent of giving it to the bellhop, the sexy beast.
