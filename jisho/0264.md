heisig: "This character is so logical that one is tempted to let the elements speak for themselves: <i>water</i> . . . <i>before</i>. But we have already decided we will not allow such rationalism to creep into our stories. Not even this once. Instead, let us change the character from the Peanuts comic strip called &quot;Pigpen,&quot; who is always preceded by a little cloud of dust and grime, and rename him &quot;<b>Wash</b>-Out.&quot; Everywhere he walks, a spray of <i>water</i> goes <i>before</i> him to sanitize everything he touches."

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Melamelachan">Melamelachan</a>] 3-8-2007(16): In 1525, the city of Salzburg was occupied. Legend has it that there was nothing left to eat, except for one <em>cow</em>. To trick the occupying forces, people would paint the cow, and send a human (with <em>human legs</em>) and the <em>cow</em> out for a walk, clearly visible to the enemies. Then, they would use some <em>water</em> to <strong>wash</strong> the <em>cow</em> and paint it with a different colour and so on. Seeing there were still plenty of <em>cows</em> left, the occupiers finally gave up. The people of Salzburg are still called <em>cow</em>-<strong>wash</strong>ers.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 14-9-2009(5): This kanji is easy. Don&#039;t think of the right part as &quot;before&quot;. Just imagine yourself using <em>water</em> to<strong> wash</strong> a <em>cow</em> with <em>human legs</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/futnuh">futnuh</a>] 27-8-2009(5): Note: This <em>before</em> primitive is physical (in front of), not temporal (happened prior to). Most stories listed here use the temporal meaning???
