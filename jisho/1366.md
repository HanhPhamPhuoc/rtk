## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-2-2008(214): Luke, I am your<strong> father</strong>. Darth Vader (really surprised nobody put this one up before: 2 laserswords).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sleepyday">sleepyday</a>] 26-10-2008(59): Not to confuse anyone, but I think if you put your mind to it, you can see the image of a<strong> father</strong> here. The first two strokes take on the form of his eye brows, and the third and fourth stroke make up the nose and mustache.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alantin">alantin</a>] 21-6-2008(21): It is a pictograph of your dad tying his tie!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 26-2-2009(15): My two gay <strong>fathers</strong>. The Sitcom (really surprised nobody put this one up before: 2 cockswords).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vengeorgeb">vengeorgeb</a>] 17-5-2009(13): Pictograph of<strong> father</strong>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97627349">http://www.flickr.com/photos/97627349</a>@N00/19312460.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 5-10-2010(4): This looks like a pictograph of a japanese<strong> father</strong>, with his eyes lashed and his mouth squeezed like an X... he&#039;s trying to kiss you, run!!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 4-4-2009(4): The <em>taskmaster</em> turned<strong> father</strong> holds two <em>drops</em> of joy up in his hands (his children).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miyadamuraman">miyadamuraman</a>] 13-10-2011(3): I&#039;ve always seen this kanji as two hammers, which a<strong> FATHER</strong> wields when he goes off to his man-job in the coal mine or something.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cuiki">cuiki</a>] 26-3-2010(3): I know a song that goes: ..my daddy was a miner and I&#039;m a miner&#039;s son.... This kanji and mining symbol look suprisingly alike.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 4-8-2010(2): 父兄 , <a href="../1274">father</a> (#1274 父) フ, ちち, おとうさん ... Parts: 八 , メ ... TIP: To write this for handwriting recognition, <em>Animal Legs</em> above, and Katakana メ below works best. So <strong>Dad</strong> says I love <em>ME</em> some <em>Animal Legs</em>: leg of lamb, Hamhocks, whatever. I love <em>Me</em> some <em>Animal legs</em> ... 熟語 : ... cf:.
