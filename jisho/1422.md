## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 8-4-2007(163): You have trouble squeezing your hand through the hole so you use a saw to enlarge it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 27-3-2008(99): (Thanks DrJones) You<strong> squeeze</strong> the teats of the cow with your <em>fingers</em> but it&#039;s your first try and you don&#039;t have any milk come through the <em>holes</em>, so you take a <em>saw</em> and cut the teats to make bigger <em>holes</em>. Poor cow, this story<strong> squeeze</strong>s my heart.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 29-3-2008(94): Very simple visual image makes this an easy kanji to remember. Just picture that you<strong> SQUEEZE</strong> your FINGERS going through the HOLE in the handle of the SAW. You then<strong> SQUEEZE</strong> your FINGERS tight to use the SAW to cut a HOLE.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 22-9-2008(43): To<strong> squeeze</strong> is to hold something <a href="../2614">tight</a> (#2614 窄) in your <em>fingers</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 20-5-2009(29): Oh no! You cut a <em>hole</em> in your <em>finger</em> with a <em>saw</em>!<strong> Squeeze</strong> your <em>finger</em> to stop the bleeding!!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 13-10-2009(22): I tried to <strong>squeeze</strong> my <em>fingers</em> into a <em>hole</em>, but they got stuck, so I had to <em>saw</em> them off :-(.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 4-6-2008(14): She&#039;s my main<strong> squeeze</strong>. If you put your <em>fingers</em> in her <em>hole</em> again I&#039;ll <em>saw</em> them off.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/digicult">digicult</a>] 15-6-2009(7): I was getting this confused with <a href="../1348">strangle</a> (#1348 絞), so here&#039;s a slight variation on the story. I have a <em>Paris Hilton</em><strong> squeeze</strong> toy, and every time I<strong> squeeze</strong> it with my <em>fingers</em>, it says &quot;That&#039;s fierce&quot; or some other vacuous witticism. Finally I get fed up and <em>saw</em> it to pieces. See the <em>saw</em> cutting through the cheap rubber: &quot;That&#039;s fierce&quot; &quot;That&#039;s fierczze&quot; &quot;That&#039;s ghghghssaaaa.....&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 1-1-2007(7): <strong>Fingers</strong>, the thief, is usually pretty good at the <em>squeeze</em>. But this time, the <strong>hole</strong> is too small up there, so he must draw out his small <strong>saw</strong> from his ankle holster if he&#039;s to <em>squeeze</em> through at all.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 13-2-2008(5): 「乍　・　ながら　simultaneously」 In order to milk a cow, you<strong> squeeze</strong> two teats of the cow&#039;s udder <em>simultaneously</em> with your <em>fingers</em>, so that the milk comes out from its <em>holes</em>.
