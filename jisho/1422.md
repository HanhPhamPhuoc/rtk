## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 1-3-2007(207): The <em>Easter Bunny</em> dropped an <strong>egg</strong> on my desk and got yolk all over my <em>receipts</em> and <em>stamps</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 1-7-2007(27): The Easter Bunny (<em>hare</em>) drops a few <em>drops</em> of<strong> egg</strong> yolk while hiding easter<strong> Egg</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 11-2-2008(22): The Easter Bunny is hiding an easter<strong> EGG</strong> in each of its ears.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 5-3-2009(15): Sorry folks, but this looks like a pictogram of male private parts, with dots marking the<strong> egg</strong>-shaped bits.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Medialis">Medialis</a>] 8-4-2010(12): Simple: Pictogram of the cracking of an<strong> egg</strong>. One half in each hand.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 30-1-2008(9): I need to paste this <em>stamp</em> into the <em>receipt</em>, but instead of glue I use some <em>egg</em> yoke. I wonder if it will hold? (Note that the &quot;drop&quot; is the next-to-last stroke on each side, unlike it says on the book.).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sskaggs">sskaggs</a>] 10-9-2011(4): Bet you didn&#039;t know that the easter hare (<a href="../2041">sign of the hare</a> (#2041 卯)) carries the easter<strong> egg</strong>s in his ears when he goes about on delivery, you can even see the little <em>Drops</em> in each ear indicating the<strong> egg</strong>s. He has to hop very carefully because of this, though, otherwise he may drop the<strong> egg</strong>s on someone&#039;s <em>receipts</em> and <em>stamps</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 23-9-2008(4): Don&#039;t get <em>drops</em> of<strong> egg</strong> on your <em>rebate</em> or you won&#039;t be able to send it in.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 27-8-2009(3): Looks a bit like a pair of ovaries with a squirt in each one.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 1-7-2010(2): <em>Dropped</em><strong> egg</strong>s are a <em>sign of the hare</em>&#039;s presence.
