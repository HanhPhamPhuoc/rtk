## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kyldyyr">kyldyyr</a>] 17-11-2005(224): Before shooting an <em>old man</em> with a <em>slingshot</em>, one shold carefully<strong> consider</strong> the possible consequences.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 14-3-2007(82): Even though he had the <em>old man</em> Mr. Wilson within the sights of his <em>slingshot</em>, Dennis the Menace <strong>considered</strong> what he was doing and stopped.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Fluhk">Fluhk</a>] 20-5-2006(31): As a last resort, we actually might<strong> consider</strong> sending our <em>old men</em> into the battle, armed with <em>slingshots</em> only...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 14-2-2007(27): Think Rod Serling:<strong> Consider</strong> this. An <em>old man</em> picks up his childhood <em>slingshot</em> and<strong> consider</strong>s his past. Yet, this seemingly innocent act will set in motion his final trip into, The Twilight Zone.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 16-10-2008(21): <strong>Consider</strong> what would happen if we took the <em>spoon</em> away from the <a href="../1251">old man</a> (#1251 老) and gave him a slingshot instead. (Creamed spinach all over the nursing home walls?).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-6-2006(13): Incidentally, the first stroke of the slingshot is drawn reverse in this kanji. Normally it&#039;s drawn from left to right, but here it&#039;s from right to left. So<strong> consider</strong> what would happen if we were to put our old men to war, armed with slingshots: with their weak grips the strip of rubber would slip from their fingers, and they would.. uh.. shoot prematurely.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamestaverner">jamestaverner</a>] 7-2-2008(10): &quot;<strong>Consider</strong> yourself...at home!&quot; - when Oliver! joins <em>old man</em> Fagin&#039;s gang, he&#039;s given a <em>slingshot</em>. Harmless Victorian weapon for a gang of petty child thieves.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mylriahd">Mylriahd</a>] 15-3-2010(4): Before shooting an <em>old man</em> with a <em>slingshot</em>,<strong> consider</strong> this: What is the current wind speed?

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Apple_Head">Apple_Head</a>] 3-10-2009(4): I&#039;m calling the <em>old man</em> primitive <em>John McCain</em>. Story: <em>John McCain</em><strong> consider</strong>ed hitting Barrack Obama with a <em>slingshot</em>. He decided not to because he realized the American people would definitely<strong> consider</strong> him unfit for presidency after that.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Norman">Norman</a>] 2-10-2012(3): An <em>old man</em> with a <em>slingshot</em> is<strong> consider</strong>ed dangerous.
