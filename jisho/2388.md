## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(23): The idiot savant was thought to be a<strong> quack</strong> because he couldn&#039;t help but count the <em>number</em> of <em>flowers</em> he saw.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 4-12-2008(23): I don&#039;t even know where Heisig got this keyword from. Using &quot;thicket&quot; instead: Picture a thicket with a large number of flowers.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 10-5-2010(19): Notes: Keyword &quot;quack&quot; was presumably chosen due to its use in the compound 薮医者 , but the general meaning of this kanji is bush/thicket. Also note that it mostly appears in its alternate form: 藪.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 13-1-2007(9): The<strong> quack</strong> travels around with a <em>number</em> of impressive looking <em>flowers</em> that are supposed to be good for something, but really don&#039;t work at all.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 12-11-2010(5): 薮医者 =藪医者 藪の中 =薮の中, 竹藪 =竹薮, 薮蛇 =藪蛇), 藪睨み <a href="../2403">quack</a> (#2403 薮) やぶ ... Parts:艹, 数 (數）(cf 藪<a href="../34282">Unicode-0x85ea</a> (#34282 藪), ) ... Note: Nelson: 4088, Spahn: 3k15.1. Usu written as 藪 with 婁 <a href="../23105">Unicode-0x5a41</a> (#23105 婁), not 娄<a href="../23044">Unicode-0x5a04</a> (#23044 娄) ... Story: At the dawn of political correctness, a term was needed to replace the offensive term for a <strong>Quack</strong>:Bush Doctor. The result was <strong>Thicket</strong> Doctor, a man with any <em>Number</em> of medicines made from <em>Daisies</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 18-10-2010(4): The<strong> quack</strong> doctor uses <em>flowers</em> and numerology (<em>numbers</em>) to diagnose.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 28-8-2009(3): +1 to Herman - Kodansha and many other renown dictionaries dont list &quot;Quack&quot; in this character individually or even in compounds. True Meaning: (thicket, bush, underbrush, grove) Story: A rare NUMBER of FLOWERS are only to be found in dense thickets.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 2-9-2010(2): The<strong> quack</strong> prescribed mere <em>flowers</em> for such a huge <em>number</em> of his patients that people stopped going to him.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 6-11-2010(1): The<strong> quack</strong> doctor 藪医者 likes to run naked into thickets and try to count the number of flowers he finds. SECOND STORY: (for the more common version of this kanji 藪, thx Katsuo) The part that replaces rice looks like a crosshairs and 中 , so I say the the authorities have the<strong> quack</strong> doctor IN their CROSSHAIRS, because of attempts to <em>taskmaster women</em> in the bushes when he&#039;s counting <em>flowers</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 6-12-2007(1): <strong>Quack</strong>s have a <em>number</em> of shady herbal (<em>flower</em>) remedies for you to try.
